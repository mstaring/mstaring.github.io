For tumors situated deeper in the animal close to critical organs, determination of the actual dose distribution and conformity is challenging especially for Bragg peak irradiations. Therefore, it is important to optimize beam properties, verify CT HU-RSP calibration, and ensure the quality of dose distributions.<br/>In this work, we present a simulation framework that (1) allows generation of realistic X-ray μ-CBCT images, (2) facilitates CT HU calibration, and (3) performs proton dose calculations.<br/>A μ-CBCT model was developed using the fastCAT toolkit. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to generate the primary and scatter kernels and imaging dose calibration appropriate for μ-CBCT scans. CTs were then generated for a mini Gammex phantom and the MOBY/ROBY digital rodent phantoms. The HU - SPR conversion is performed with the mini Gammex phantom. The resulting calibration parameters are then used to convert the CTs of the MOBY/ROBY phantoms to SPR maps. These are then used to calculate dose distributions in TOPAS for treatment plans created in matRad using realistic beams based on measured emittances and simulations of the beam transport with BDSIM. Since the composition of the MOBY/ROBY phantoms is known, a ground truth exists against which the accuracy of the calibration and dose distributions can be verified.<br/>This framework is used to optimize the irradiation setup and assess the quality of small animal irradiations.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">Malimban:2023</span><span class="p">,</span>

In this short paper we investigate the effects of rigid-body motion on AI-based reconstructions. Leveraging the Bloch equations we simulate motion corrupted MRI acquisitions with a linear interleaved scanning protocol including spin history effects, and investigate i) the effect on reconstruction quality, and ii) if this corruption can be mitigated by introducing motion-corrupted data during training. We observe an improvement from 0.787 to 0.844 in terms of SSIM when motion-corrupted brain data is included during training, demonstrating that training with motion-corrupted data can partially compensate for motion corruption.

Since deep learning algorithms have shown excellent performance on human organ segmentation, their application for animals have also been recently explored. However, previously developed deep learning-based animal autocontouring models were mostly trained on one type of dataset, and their predictive performance was also evaluated on the same distribution as the training data. In a preclinical facility wherein studies involving various strains of animals and image acquisition protocols are performed, it is important to demonstrate the robustness of these tools across different populations and settings. Therefore, in this work, we externally validated two deep learning pipelines for mouse thorax segmentation to assess their usability and portability when implemented on a larger scale.<br/><b>Materials &amp; Methods: </b>We trained the 2D and 3D models of nnU-Net (i.e., one of the best performing algorithms for clinical segmentation) and compared them with the state-of-the-art AIMOS pipeline for segmentation of the mouse thorax. We allotted 105 native micro-CT scans of mice for the training and initially performed internal validation using 35 native micro-CT scans not included in the model development to determine the best nnU-Net model. Then, the proposed nnU-Net model and AIMOS were externally validated using 35 contrast-enhanced micro-CTs, which comprise of scans with a different mouse strain and imaging parameters than the training data. The predictive performance was evaluated in terms of the Dice score (DSC), mean surface distance (MSD), and 95% Hausdorff distance (95% HD).<br/><b>Results: </b>When tested against native micro-CTs, all models of nnU-Net (3d_fullres, 3d_cascade, 3d_lowres, 2d) and AIMOS generated accurate contours, achieving average DSC greater than 0.94, 0.90, 0.97 and 0.95 for the heart, spinal cord, right and left lungs, respectively. The average MSD was less than the in-plane voxel size of 0.14 mm while the average 95% HD was below 0.60 mm except for the right lung results of nnU-Net 2d. Among the nnU-Net models, 3d_fullres was considered the superior model, producing the most accurate contours at a reasonable speed. The nnU-Net 3d_fullres model and AIMOS were then evaluated against the external dataset. The nnU-Net 3d_fullres model achieved average DSC of 0.92, 0.85, 0.96 and 0.95 whereas AIMOS showed inferior results: 0.83, 0.82, 0.87 and 0.77. Consistent for all organs, AIMOS recorded unacceptably large 95% HD &gt; 1 mm and produced incomplete contours. Moreover, AIMOS failed to distinguish the right lung from left lung. These entail that AIMOS requires more labor-intensive corrections than nnU-Net 3d_fullres for data on which the model was not trained on.<br/><b>Conclusion: </b>We have shown that the nnU-Net 3d_fullres model is more robust and generalizable than the current best performing algorithm for mouse segmentation (AIMOS). Our findings also demonstrate the importance of thoroughly evaluating the performance of autocontouring tools before implementation in routine preclinical practice.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">Malimban:2022</span><span class="p">,</span>

However, currently it has failed to reach widespread clinical adoption. The main factors include the intersubject variability in local specific absorption rate (SAR) leading to large safety margins to ensure compliance to regulatory limits, and time-consuming B1<sup>+</sup> calibration procedures required for tailored RF pulse design.

In clinical practice, manual linear measurements are performed from MRI. Manual 3D measurement is time-consuming and 2D measurement is subjective and reflects highly variable tumour volume poorly. We developed an AI model to detect and segment VS from MRI automatically.<br/><b>Purpose/Objectives:</b> We present a model for the detection and segmentation of VS, based on deep learning and suited to process multi-centre, multi-vendor MR images. The model’s performance is evaluated and compared to humans in an observer study.<br/><b>Methods &amp; materials:</b> In total 214 cases (134 VS positive and 80 negative) with gadolinium-enhanced T1 and native T2 weighted MR images were acquired from 37 centres and 12 different MRI scanners. The intra- and extra meatal parts of the tumour were manually delineated by two observers under supervision of an experienced head and neck radiologist. Cases were divided into three non-overlapping sets (training, validation, and testing). A model was trained using 3D no-new-Unet deep learning segmentation method. In addition, an observer study was performed, in which the radiologist blinded to case information and delineation method compared model and human delineations.<br/><b>Results:</b> The model correctly detected VS in all positive cases and excluded the negative. Evaluation of the T1 model compared to the human delineation resulted in a Dice index 90.4&pm;13.0, Hausdorff distance 2.12&pm;9.32 mm, and mean surface-to-surface distance 0.49&pm;1.52 mm. Intra and extra meatal tumour parts had Dice indices of 77.5&pm;21.3 and 82.2&pm;28.0, respectively. The observer study showed that in 103 out of 111 cases (93%) the model was comparable to or better than human delineation.<br/><b>Conclusion:</b> The proposed model can accurately detect and delineate VS from MRI in a multi-centre, multi-vendor setting. As such, it is a robust tool well suited to the reality of clinical practise. The model performed comparably to human delineations in the observer study.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">Neve:2021</span><span class="p">,</span>

In clinical practice, linear measurements are manually performed from MRI. Manual measurement is time-consuming, subjective, and restricted to 2D planes. In this study, we aim to develop a deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) model to automatically detect and segment VS in 3D from Gadolinium (Gd)-enhanced MRI.<br/><b>METHOD AND MATERIALS:</b> In total 124 patients with unilateral hearing loss referred to MRI exam were enrolled, including 84 VS-positive and 40 VS-negative cases. MRI data were acquired from 37 centers, by 12 different MRI scanners from 3 vendors. Typical image resolution was 0.35x0.35x1 mm, and field of view ranged from 130x130x24 mm to 270x270x188 mm. In 84 positive cases, VS was manually delineated by two observers, supervised by a senior radiologist. The 124 subjects were randomly divided into three non-overlapping sets: training set (N=72), validation set (N=18), and test set (N=34). We trained a 3D no-new-Unet CNN for both VS detection and segmentation. Training was performed on a NVIDIA Tesla V100 graphics processing unit with 16GB memory.<br/><b>RESULTS:</b> Applied to the test set, the CNN correctly detected VS in 24 subjects and excluded VS in 10 (sensitivity 100%, specificity 100%). We evaluated the Dice index, Hausdorff distance, and surface to surface (S2S) distance in two scenarios, namely, CNN vs. observer 1, and observer 1 vs. observer 2. No significant differences were found: Dice 0.91&pm;0.06 vs 0.92&pm;0.05 (p=0.5 by paired Wilcoxon test), Hausdorff 1.3&pm;1.5mm vs. 1.2&pm;1.0 mm (p=0.6), S2S 0.4&pm;0.3 mm vs. 0.4&pm;0.2 mm (p=0.9). The annotation time was 6.0&pm;3.3 min for the observer and 2.5&pm;2.8 min for the CNN model.<br/><b>CONCLUSION:</b> In a multi-center and multi-vendor setting, a CNN model can accurately detect and delineate VS in 3D from Gd-enhanced MRI, to faciliate diagnosis and measurement of VS in clinical practice.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">Tao:2020</span><span class="p">,</span>

Since the effect of BPA in untreated (i.e. unobstructed) PAs is unknown, we investigated the treatment response in treated and untreated PAs, by analyzing CT Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA).<br/><b>Methods and Materials:</b> We studied 22 consecutive CTEPH patients (20 female; age: 67 &pm; 14), who underwent CTPA and right-heart catheterization (RHC), pre- and post-BPA. In consensus, three experts selected treated artery segments based on the BPA locations and approximately 5 untreated artery segments at a similar level. Post-BPA CTPA scans were registered to pre-BPA scans, and local intravascular density changes were measured. The median density change in treated (MDC<sub>T</sub>) and untreated segments (MDC<sub>U</sub>) was calculated, based on manual selections. The difference between MDC<sub>U</sub> and MDC<sub>T</sub> was tested by paired T-test. The difference in density changes (&Delta;MDC) between treated and untreated PAs was calculated (MDC<sub>T</sub>-MDC<sub>U</sub>). Changes in RHC parameters included systolic, diastolic and mean pulmonary artery pressure (&Delta;sPAP, &Delta;dPAP and &Delta;mPAP) and in pulmonary vascular resistance (&Delta;PVR). The relation between hemodynamic changes and &Delta;MDC was studied with Spearman’s correlation.<br/><b>Results:</b> MDC<sub>T</sub> (51 &pm; 85 HU) and MDC<sub>U</sub> (-23 &pm; 103 HU) were significantly different and in opposite direction (p=0.001). &Delta;MDC was significantly correlated with &Delta;dPAP (R=-0.55, p=0.008) and &Delta;PVR (R=-0.47, p=0.026), and marginally correlated with &Delta;mPAP (R=-0.4, p=0.068).<br/><b>Conclusion:</b> Perfusion in treated PAs increased, whereas perfusion in untreated PAs decreased. Not only improved perfusion in treated arteries, but also normalization in untreated arteries may play a significant role in improving hemodynamics by BPA.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">Zhai:2020</span><span class="p">,</span>

Vascular structures are a rich descriptor of the organ deformation, since it permeates through all organs within body. As vasculature differs in size, shape and topology, following surgical intervention/treatment or due to disease progression, non-rigid vessel matching remains a challenging task. Recently, hybrid mixture models (HdMM) have been applied to tackle this challenge, and demonstrate significant improvements in terms of accuracy and robustness relative to the state-of-the-art. However, the smoothness constraint enforced on the deformation field with this approach only accounts for the global topology of the vasculature, resulting in a reduced capacity to accurately match localized changes to vascular structures, and preserve local topology. In this work, we proposed a modified version of HdMM by formulating an adaptive kernel, to enforce a local smoothness constraint on the deformation field, henceforth referred to as HdMMad. The proposed HdMMad framework is evaluated with cerebral and pulmonary vasculature, acquired retrospectively. The registration results for both data sets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms registration algorithms also designed to preserve local topology. Using HdMMad, around 80% of the initial registration error was reduced, for both data sets.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">Bayer:2019</span><span class="p">,</span>

Hadamard time-encoded(te) pCASL allows time-efficient acquisition of dynamic ASL-data and when done with and without flow-crushing, 4D MRA and arterial input function measurements can be obtained. While improving quantification, this approach is also a factor two slower. In this study, we propose an end-to-end 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) in order to accelerate CBF quantification from sparse sampling (50%) of te-pCASL with and without flow crushers. For training and evaluation of the CNN, we propose a framework to simulate the te-PCASL signal.<br/><b>Subjects and Methods:</b> Fig. 1a shows the proposed framework for generating the training and validation data. The ASL signal is simulated by a tracer kinetic model of te-pCASL. This model is a function of arterial arrival time, tissue arrival time and blood flow, which were extracted from in vivo data and registered to BrainWeb scans. This study contains 1676 simulated subjects, each including crushed and non-crushed input data at 8 timepoints, and angiographic and perfusion output data at 7 timepoints. The proposed CNN, Fig. 1b, leverages design elements from DenseNet with loop connectivity patterns in a typical U-shape ( 400K parameters). We leverage a Huber loss function for training the network, with weights based on the gradient magnitudes from Fig. 2a. In order to manage memory usage, we utilize patch-based training. The simulated dataset was divided into 1174 subjects for training, 167 for validation, and 335 for testing. For augmenting the training data, noise, flipping and &pm;13<sup>∘</sup> rotation have been applied randomly. The network was trained for 30k iterations.<br/><b>Results:</b> Fig. 2b, shows the network’s training loss for the perfusion and angiography separately and their combination. The average MSE for the perfusion and the angiography is 5.30&pm;0.22 and 5.02&pm;0.17. Fig. 3 shows the outputs of the network for some slices of perfusion/angiography at different timepoints. Due to the averaging property in the Huber loss function, the results suffer from over-smoothing. It takes an average of 0.12&pm;0.18s to reconstruct all perfusion and angiography scans from the sparsely-sampled crushed/noncrushed data (size 101<sup>3</sup>).<br/><b>Discussion/Conclusion:</b> This study demonstrates that CNNs are promising to reconstruct angiographic and perfusion images from sparsely sampled Hadamard ASL-data. A next step is the use of perceptual losses to improve sharpness of the results, as well as validation on in vivo data.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">Yousefi:2019</span><span class="p">,</span>

Two MRI exams and daily pre- and post-irradiation CBCT scans were acquired in the first week of radiotherapy. Weekly CBCT scans were acquired thereafter for patients that received LC-CRT. Between the two MRI exams, the fiducial displacement relative to the center of gravity of the GTV (COG<sub>GTV</sub>) and the COG<sub>GTV</sub> displacement relative to bony anatomy was determined. Using the CBCT scans, inter- and intrafraction fiducial displacement relative to bony anatomy was determined.<br/><b>Results:</b> The systematic error of the fiducial displacement relative to the COG<sub>GTV</sub> was 2.8, 2.4 and 4.2 mm in the left-right (LR), anterior-posterior (AP) and craniocaudal (CC) direction. Large interfraction systematic errors of up to 8.0 and random errors up to 4.7 mm were found for COG<sub>GTV</sub> and fiducial displacements relative to bony anatomy, mostly in the AP and CC directions. For tumors located in the mid- and upper rectum these errors were 9.4 (systematic) and 5.6 mm (random) compared to 4.9 and 2.9 mm for tumors in the lower rectum. Systematic and random errors of the intrafraction fiducial displacement relative to bony anatomy were &lt;2.1 mm in all directions.<br/><b>Conclusions:</b> Large interfraction errors of the COG<sub>GTV</sub> and the fiducials relative to bony anatomy were found. Therefore, despite the observed fiducial displacement relative to the COG<sub>GTV</sub>, the use of fiducials as a surrogate for GTV position reduces the required margins in the AP and CC direction for a GTV boost using image-guided radiotherapy of rectal cancer. This reduction may be larger in patients with tumors located in the mid- and upper rectum compared to the lower rectum.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">vandenEnde:2019</span><span class="p">,</span>

First, spot positions (Bragg peaks) from the prior plan are restored by adjusting the energy of each pencil-beam to the water-equivalent path length in the daily CT. Subsequently, to compensate for deformations of target and OARs, pencil-beams are added followed by a pencil-beam weight optimization using the Reference-Point-Method. This method generates a Pareto optimal plan for the anatomy-of-the-day, with similar trade-offs to those in the prior plan. The method was evaluated using 8-10 daily CTs of 11 prostate cancer patients (88 CTs) and 3-4 daily CTs of 5 cervical cancer patients (19 CTs). Evaluation was done by comparing for each CT a full multi-criteria optimization without time constraints (benchmark) to the proposed method and to a forward dose calculation of the prior plan on each CT (no replanning).<br/><b>Results:</b> The figures show large dosimetric differences between no replanning and benchmark, while the differences between the proposed method and benchmark are substantially smaller. The use of replanning improved target coverage to clinically acceptable levels in 85/88 CTs and 19/19 CTs for prostate and cervix, respectively. All plans showed reduced OAR doses. Replanning took on average 2.9 and 3.6 minutes for prostate and cervix, respectively, using  50% for dose computation.<br/><b>Conclusion:</b> The automation and realized replanning times make the proposed method an important step towards real-time adaptive proton therapy.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">Jagt:2019a</span><span class="p">,</span>

This makes IMPT for sites with large inter-fraction target deformations extra challenging, such as in the treatment of cervical cancer. Online replanning is an option to achieve adequate target dose in each fraction. This study evaluates a novel approach employing a pre-treatment established plan-library as prior information in automated online replanning for IMPT of cervical cancer.<br/><b>Material and Methods:</b> CT data of 5 cervical cancer patients was available, comprising of a full and empty-bladder CT and 3-4 repeat CTs. Prescribed dose for the primary tumor and pelvic &pm;para-aortic lymph nodes was 45 Gy. Pre-treatment plan-libraries were created to provide prior spot distributions for replanning on the repeat CTs. One consisted of two treatment plans based on the full and empty-bladder CT +8 mm margin and the other of one treatment plan encompassing all target deformation observed in the full and empty-bladder CT +10 mm margin, i.e. a large ITV. In case of the 2-plan-library the daily bladder volume was used to select the prior plan for replanning.<br/>The reoptimization method starts with a spot-position (Bragg peak) restoration from the selected prior plan by adjusting the energy of each pencil beam to the water equivalent path length in the repeat CT. To further compensate for deformations, new spots are added. The reference point method (RPM) is then used to optimize the spot weights. The RPM has been automatically tuned on benchmark plans of 4 CTs (i.e. optimized from scratch without time constraints) and results in a reoptimized Pareto optimal plan for the new anatomy, with similar trade-offs as in the benchmark plan. Replanning was performed for each repeat CT using tight margins of 5/2 mm (primary tumor/nodes), only meant to account for intra-fraction motion. The prior and reoptimized plans were evaluated on the repeat CTs using the 5/2 mm-PTVs and compared to benchmark plans on the repeat CTs.<br/><b>Results:</b> Evaluating the prior plans on the repeat CTs without replanning resulted in V<sub>95%</sub>&lt;95% in most CTs, with values down to 50% (see Fig 1). For both plan-library approaches, reoptimization increased the number of repeat CTs with adequate coverage (PTV V<sub>95%</sub>=95% and V<sub>107%</sub>=2%) from 2/19 to 19/19 CTs. Fig 2 shows the differences between the reoptimized and benchmark plans on the repeat CTs using the ITV or 2-plan-library as prior. Median improvements are seen up to 4.5%-point for bladder V30Gy when using the 2-plan-library instead of the ITV plan, with outliers up to 13.8%-point. Reoptimization took 3.6 min on average.<br/><b>Conclusion:</b> With fully automated replanning, adequate target coverage was restored for all CTs, as well as decreased OAR doses. The use of a 2-plan-library yielded lower OAR doses than a single ITV prior plan. With an average time of 3.6 minutes, this method is an important step towards online-adaptive IMPT in cervical cancer.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">Jagt:2019b</span><span class="p">,</span>

One of the major challenges here is the development and validation of sufficiently fast, accurate, and robust segmentation algorithms for target volumes and organs at risk. The purpose of this study is to improve contour propagation in the pelvic region by combining deep-learning based auto-segmentation with image registration and to validate it geometrically and dosimetrically for online-adaptive Proton Therapy (PT) for prostate cancer.<br/><b>Material and Methods:</b> The proposed registration pipeline registers the daily CT scan to the planning, based on a combination of image intensities and, moreover, by an automatic segmentation of the bladder from the daily CT scan using a novel 3D convolutional neural network. The bladder was chosen for its influence on prostate motion. Registration performance is further enhanced by a digital inpainting of gas pockets with realistic bowel content, using a state-of-the-art generative adversarial network. We further perform data normalization and in relevant cases digitally remove contrast agent from the bladder.<br/>Evaluation was performed on CT data from 18 prostate cancer patients, each with 7 to 10 repeat CT scans. Manual delineations of the prostate, lymph nodes, seminal vesicles, bladder and rectum were available for evaluation. Geometric performance was quantified using the Mean Surface Distance (MSD). The pipeline was validated dosimetrically on 11 out of 18 patients by simulating an online-adaptive PT workflow based on the propagated contours. To this end, for each repeat CT, a treatment plan was generated based on the propagated contours and the plan was evaluated using the manual delineations. A dose of 74 Gy was assigned to the high-dose PTV (prostate) and 55 Gy to the low-dose PTV (lymph nodes and seminal vesicles). The generated treatment plans were considered clinically acceptable if dosimetric coverage constraints derived from the manual contours were met (PTV V<sub>95%</sub> = 98% and V<sub>107%</sub> = 2%).<br/><b>Results:</b> The proposed pipeline achieved a MSD of 1.29 &pm; 0.33, 1.44 &pm; 0.68, and 1.52 &pm; 0.45 mm for the prostate, seminal vesicles, and lymph nodes, respectively (Fig. 1). The propagated contours met the dose coverage constraints in 85%, 91%, and 99% of the cases for the prostate, seminal vesicles, and lymph nodes, respectively (Fig. 2). 78% of the cases met all constraints at the same time, compared to 65% when using a standard registration approach. The average runtime for the proposed pipeline is 98 seconds per registration.<br/><b>Conclusion:</b> The proposed registration pipeline obtained highly promising results for generating treatment plans adapted to the daily anatomy. With 78% of the automatically generated treatment plans directly usable without manual correction, a substantial improvement in system robustness was reached compared to an existing approach. The proposed method therefore facilitates more precise PT of prostate cancer.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">Elmahdy:2019</span><span class="p">,</span>

However, registration methods are implemented in a large variety of toolboxes, and the methods are rarely compared on the same datasets. The lack of standardization makes it challenging for end-users to select the right registration algorithm and hyperparameters for their application.<br/>To standardize comparison, registration methods can enter a Grand Challenge (GC). GCs are competitions with standardized data sets, evaluation methods, and experimental setups that focus on specific research topics. The experiments are run by third parties which ensures fair, independent evaluations. However, most modern GCs are static, one-time events, that allow closed source contributions. This hampers collaboration and reproducibility.<br/><b>Methods:</b> To address these limitations, and inspired by modern software development practices, we proposed the Continuous Registration Challenge (CRC). For this challenge, we developed a fully automatic platform for benchmarking registration methods on many different data sets. The platform consists of a C++ API for running registrations, a Python framework and a Continuous Integration system for running experiments, a compute backend, and a website with public leaderboards. The platform and all submissions are open source. The C++ API, SuperElastix, was designed with a role-base architecture that allows many different registration paradigms to co-exist in the same framework. The challenge focuses on pairwise registration of lungs and brains, two problems frequently encountered in clinical settings.<br/><b>Results:</b> The system described above is used for the Continuous Registration Challenge. The system allows researchers to test their methods in a standardized way, using a fully automatic experimental setup. The experiments are running every week, and participants can follow the leaderboards, which are updated every weekend (<a href="https://continuousregistration.grand-challenge.org/leaderboard/">https://continuousregistration.grand-challenge.org/leaderboard/</a>). The leaderboards will continue to be updated and the repository will be open for contributions even after the challenge ends. The results will be presented and discussed at the Workshop On Biomedical Image Registration (WBIR 2018, <a href="https://wbir2018.nl/">https://wbir2018.nl/</a>). All participants are invited to collaborate on a paper which we plan to submit to a leading journal in the field.<br/><b>Conclusion:</b> We present an open source framework for the continuous and automated benchmarking of image registration algorithms.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">Marstal:2018</span><span class="p">,</span>

Dose response analyses suggest that higher tumor doses result in higher complete response rates. Tumor dose can be increased by applying a boost with external beam radiotherapy, endorectal brachytherapy or contact therapy. With position verification using CT, CBCT or a radiograph, verification of tumor position is difficult due to limited soft tissue contrast. Fiducial markers can be used as a surrogate for tumor position, after their position relative to the tumor is established on MRI. The aim of this study was to evaluate the MRI visibility of different gold fiducial markers implanted in the tumor, rectal wall or mesorectum.<br/><b>Material/methods:</b> We included 20 rectal cancer patients who received neoadjuvant (chemo)radiotherapy. Three or four markers were inserted in the tumor, rectal wall or mesorectum by sigmoidoscopy or endoscopic-ultrasonography. We tested 4 marker types (Visicoil (0.5x5 mm and 0.75x5 mm)[IBA Dosimetry, GmbH, Germany], Cook 0.64x3.4 mm [Cook Medical, Limerick, Ireland] and Gold Anchor 0.28x20 mm [Naslund Medical AB, Sweden]), each placed in 5 patients. Two radiologists and two radiation oncologists were blinded for marker type and identified marker locations on MRI in two scenarios: without (scenario A) and with (scenario B) a rigidly registered CT or CBCT with markers available to aid in identifying the marker locations on MRI. Included MRI sequences were a transverse and a sagittal T2-TSE, a T1 3D with short TE (1.6-2.5 ms), a T1 3D with long TE (5-15 ms) and a transverse B0 map. Observers labeled marker positions on the sequence on which the marker could most accurately be identified. In addition, the observers graded the visibility of each identified marker on each sequence (0=not visible, 1=poor/average, 2=good/excellent). A marker was defined to be consistently identified if at least three observers labeled that marker on the same position on MRI.<br/><b>Results:</b> Of the 64 inserted markers, 41 were still present at the time of MRI as determined on corresponding CT or CBCT. Table 1 summarizes the results for scenario B. The Gold Anchor marker was the most consistently identified marker (9 out of 12). In comparison, in scenario A only 4 out of 12 present Gold Anchor markers were consistently identified. The consistently identified Gold Anchor markers were best visible on the T1 3D (long TE) sequence (86% good/excellent) and 73% were labeled on that sequence. The markers were least visible on both T2-TSE sequences (43-46% good/excellent). Examples of the Gold Anchor marker on the different MRI sequences are shown in Figure 1.<br/><b>Conclusion:</b> The Gold Anchor marker was the best visible marker on MRI as it was the most consistently identified marker. The use of a rigidly registered CT or CBCT improves marker identification on MRI. Standard anatomical MRI sequences are not sufficient to identify markers, it is therefore recommended to include a T1 3D (long TE) sequence.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">vandenEnde:2018</span><span class="p">,</span>

The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of using PG emission profiles to monitor dosimetric changes in pencil beam scanning (PBS) proton therapy as a result of day-to-day variation in patient anatomy.<br/><b>Material/methods:</b> We included 11 prostate patients with a planning CT scan and 7-9 repeat CT scans (99 CT scans in total), illustrating daily variation in patient anatomy. For each patient, we had a PBS treatment plan with two lateral fields. We determined the real-time PG emission profiles on a cylindrical surface around the patient by simulating each plan on the planning CT and on the repeat CT scans of each patient using the Geant4-based TOPAS Monte Carlo code. The scored (i.e. detected) PGs were discriminated on the basis of energy (E &ge; 1 MeV) and angle of incidence (87&deg; &le; &theta; &le; 93&deg;) so as to select PGs perpendicular to the treatment beam. The treatment plans consisted of a mean of 1417 spots and the PGs were scored for each spot individually.<br/>From the planned and simulated dose distributions, we determined the V95% of the GTV and the Dmean and V60Gy of the rectum. Next, the PG profiles that corresponded with the 5% most intense spots (i.e. with the highest number of protons) were selected. We fitted sigmoid functions to the falloff region of all selected PG emission profiles and used the 50% point of the sigmoid curve (X50) as a measure for the falloff location (which is known to correlate strongly with the Bragg peak location of the corresponding spot). We used the distribution of the absolute differences between the X50 (&vert;&Delta;X50&vert;) of all selected spots simulated using the planning CT scan and the repeat CT scans for each patient as a measure of similarity between simulations. To evaluate the validity of using &vert;&Delta;X50&vert;, we determined Pearson correlation coefficients (r) between the mean and standard deviation (SD) of &vert;&Delta;X50&vert; and dosimetric differences between simulations.<br/><b>Results:</b> Figure 1 illustrates dosimetric differences due to anatomical changes. An increase in Dmean and V60Gy of the rectum of up to 16.0 Gy and 13.6%-point, respectively, and a decrease in V95% of the GTV of up to 20.7%-point, were observed. Measurable correlations were observed between the change in V95% when simulating the treatment plan on the repeat CT scans and the mean &vert;&Delta;X50&vert; (&vert;r&vert;=0.51 for 6 out of 11 patients; mean &vert;r&vert; of 0.56 (SD: 0.29)). In addition, the SD of &vert;&Delta;X50&vert; appears to be a potential predictor for a change in Dmean of the rectum (&vert;r&vert;=0.58 for 6 patients; mean &vert;r&vert; of 0.46 (SD: 0.29)) (Figure 2). No significant predictor was found for V60Gy due to the small mean difference between simulations.<br/><b>Conclusion:</b> These promising results show, as a proof of principle, that PG emission profiles can be used to monitor daily dosimetric changes in proton therapy as a result of day-to-day anatomical variation.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">Lens:2018</span><span class="p">,</span>

To gain more insight into this variation, we aimed to visualize and quantify changes in lung perfusion using CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA). We validated these measurements of perfusional changes against hemodynamic changes measured during right-heart catheterization.<br/><b>Materials and Methods:</b> We studied 14 consecutive CTEPH patients (12 female; age: 65&pm;17), who underwent CTPA and right-heart catheterization, before and after BPA. Post-treatment images were registered to pre-treatment CT scans (using the Elastix toolbox) to obtain corresponding locations. Pulmonary vascular trees and their centerlines were detected using a graph-cuts method and distance transform. Areas distal from vessels were defined for measuring perfusional changes in the parenchyma. Subsequently, the density changes within the vascular and parenchymal areas were calculated and corrected for inspiration level differences, and displayed in color-coded overlays. For quantification, the median and inter-quartile range (IQR) of the density changes were calculated in the vascular and parenchymal areas (&Delta;VD and &Delta;PD, respectively). The recorded changes in hemodynamic parameters included changes in systolic, diastolic and mean pulmonary artery pressure (&Delta;sPAP, &Delta;dPAP and &Delta;mPAP, respectively) and in vascular resistance (&Delta;PVR). The Spearman’s correlation coefficients between perfusional changes and hemodynamic changes were tested.<br/><b>Results:</b> PAP and PVR were significantly improved after BPA. Comparative imaging maps showed distinct patterns in perfusional changes between patients. Within vessels, the IQR of &Delta;VD correlated with &Delta;sPAP (R=-0.58, p=0.03), &Delta;dPAP (R=-0.71, p=0.005), &Delta;mPAP (R=-0.71, p=0.005) and &Delta;PVR (R=-0.77, p=0.001, see Figure). In the parenchyma, the median of &Delta;PD correlated with &Delta;dPAP (R=-0.71, p=0.005) and &Delta;mPAP (R=-0.68, p =0.008).<br/><b>Conclusion:</b> Comparative imaging in CTEPH patients offers insight into differences in BPA treatment effect. Quantification of these perfusional changes provides non-invasive measures that reflect hemodynamic changes.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">Zhai:2017</span><span class="p">,</span>

However, applying DIR may result in unrealistic tissues expansion or folding, particularly in the case of tumor shrinkage. We developed and evaluated two registration approaches of T2-weighted (T2W) MRI for spatial mapping of tumor and mesorectum.<br/><b>Methods and Materials:</b> Thirteen patients received weekly repeated T2W-MRI (3T) for five weeks (n=62 scans). Both approaches were implemented in Elastix, using a B-splines transformation and mutual information as a similarity metric. For registration of non-tumor structures in the mesorectum manually selected landmarks and/or rectum contours were utilized to refine the registration when needed. For tumor mapping, the transit point from tumor to normal rectum wall was used for tumor alignment assuming tumor volume preservation.<br/><b>Results:</b> Registration of non-tumor structures resulted in average dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 90&pm;6% and mean surface distance (MSD) of 1.53&pm;0.48mm between mesorectum segmentations. Refinement using landmarks was required for one patient improving MSD and DSC, from 18.0 to 1.27 mm and 62% to 96% respectively. Refinement using rectum contours was required for another patient improving MSD form 3.0 to 2.7 mm. Tumor mapping resulted in satisfactory alignment when evaluated visually. For an average-sized tumor ( 30cc) with 44% volume shrinkage MSD was 1.5 mm between rectum delineations.<br/><b>Conclusion:</b> We obtained accurate registrations between T2W-MRIs over time within the mesorectum.

Thus, knowledge when adulthood is reached is indispensable to discriminate developmental phase and adulthood. We are conducting a lifespan study on rats, imaging juvenile development as well as ageing processes of the brain with noninvasive techniques including functional and anatomical MRI and different PET-tracers. Here we present a high-resolution longitudinal MRI study at 11.7T of male Wistar rats between 21 days and six months of age, characterizing cerebral volume changes and tissue-specific myelination as a function of age.<br/><b>Methods</b>: Twelve Wistar rats, housed pairwise in cages, were used in MRI experiments from the age of three weeks up to three or six months, respectively. MR experiments were conducted on an 11.7T Bruker BioSpec scanner (Bruker Biospin, Germany). Animals were anaesthetized using 2% Isoflurane in 70:30 N2O:O2 and vital functions were monitored continuously. T2 maps were chosen for their anatomical detail and quantitative reproducibility; diffusion tensor imaging for information on tissue anisotropy and myelination. Maps were calculated from a multislice multiecho sequence (10 echoes) with TE=10ms, TR=5000ms, inplane resolution of 0.146x0.146mm and 0.5mm slice thickness (no gaps). For all individuals, T2 maps from the different ages were coregistered non-rigidly using a B-spline transform (1), and the corresponding deformation fields were calculated. Volumetric changes of brain regions were derived from the deformation fields. At three weeks, three and six months, a subset of four rats was sacrificed for histological evaluation using Cresyl Violet and Black and Gold II staining for myelin.<br/><b>Results</b>: Cortical thickness reaches final value at 1 month, but volume increases of cortex, of striatum and the whole brain end only after two months. Myelin accretion is pronounced till the end of the third month. Continuing myelination increases in the cortex are seen on histological analysis, but are no longer reliably detectable with diffusion-weighted MRI due to parallel tissue restructuring processes. A combination of reduced T2 and decreased cortical volume is implying an increasing tissue density (myelination and cell number) during development, lowering the relative amount of free water, and thus reducing the cortical volume. This was confirmed by histological evaluation.<br/><b>Conclusions</b>: In conclusion, cerebral development continues over the first three months of age. This is of relevance for future studies on brain disease models, which should not start before end of month 3 to exclude serious confound of continuing tissue development.<br/><b>Acknowledgement</b>: This work was financially supported by grants from BMBF (0314104) and the EU-FP7 program TargetBraIn (HEALTH-F2-2012-279017).<br/><b>References</b>: (1) Klein &amp; Staring et al.

These images allow manual or automated classification of plaque components inside the vessel wall. During scanning, patient movement may cause misalignment between the sequences. Registration is required to correct for these misalignments. Manual alignment is the current procedure, but is time-consuming; therefore automatic image registration has been applied in a number of studies. In previous work, automatic registration was only performed in 2D [1-3], while patient movement occurs in 3D, and no quantitative validation was performed [2-4]. The purpose of this study was 1) to develop an optimal 3D automatic registration method, and 2) to perform a quantitative validation of the registration results with a gold standard.<br/><b>Methods and Materials:</b> Images from fifty TIA/stroke patients with ipsilateral &lt;70&#37; carotid artery stenosis, with adequately visualized vessel wall boundaries and no imaging artifacts, were randomly selected from a larger cohort. MR images were obtained on a 1.5T scanner using a dedicated carotid surface coil (both Philips Healthcare). Five MR pulse sequences were obtained around the carotid bifurcation, each containing nine transverse slices: T1W TFE, TOF, T2W TSE, and pre- and post-contrast T1W TSE as described in [5]. Acquired pixel size was 0.39x0.39 mm<sup>2</sup> and slice thickness was 3.0 mm. All images were reconstructed to have a pixel size of 0.2x0.2 mm<sup>2</sup> in plane. The data was manually segmented by delineating the lumen contour in each vessel wall sequence, which acts as the ground truth. In this study the pre-contrast T1W TSE was used as the reference sequence. In addition, an expert manually aligned the images to this reference by applying an inplane translation to each image slice.<br/>Automatic image registrations using various transforms were investigated, being 2D translation per image slice, 3D rigid transform, 3D affine transform and 3D B-spline transform. In order to prevent the automatic registration to align the studies to the dominant neck-air boundary, a circular image mask centered over the lumen was used. Mutual information was chosen as image similarity metric, a tri-linear interpolator, and stochastic gradient descent as optimizer. In all cases various mask sizes were tested to obtain the optimal mask size. Similarly, for the 3D B-spline transform, different grid sizes of the B-splines were tested. The different registration methods were applied using publicly available <code>elastix</code> software [6].<br/>Evaluation of the automatic registration was performed by comparing the lumen segmentation of the reference image after registration with the lumen segmentation of the moving image. To compare the results of 2D and 3D registrations, all contours were converted into 3D tubular meshes and the distance between the tubular meshes was used to quantify the accuracy. A smaller distance indicates a better registration result.<br/><b>Results:</b> The box plot in Figure 1 shows the distribution of the residual registration distance. The first box shows the distance without applying any form of registration. The second box shows the results after manual registration of the expert. The remaining columns show the different automatic registration strategies. The performance of the 3D B-spline registration is very close to the manual alignment. Paired t-tests showed that there is no significant difference between the manual alignment and the 3D B-spline registration (p&lt;0.05). The optimal mask size was a circle with a diameter of 1 cm. The optimal grid size for the 3D B-spline registration was 15 mm.<br/><b>Discussion and Conclusion:</b> Different methods for the automatic registration of multispectral MR vessel wall images of the carotid artery were investigated and quantitatively validated. Registration using a 3D B-spline transform performed equally well as the manual alignment by an expert, with final result in the order of the in-plane voxel size. These results show that automatic image registration can replace the manual alignment reducing the amount of time needed analyzing carotid vessel wall images.<br/><b>References and Acknowledgements:</b><br/>[1] Biasiolli, L. et al., Proc.

To detect the changes in different regions of the brain over the life-cycle (deformation, tumor growth, etc.), the different time-points are elastically/non-rigidly registered to each other. For each elastic registration, the deformation field and the correspondent determinant of the Jacobian (detJac) are calculated. When comparing 2 different time-points the information provided by the deformation field can be used: without distorting the original data one can automatically pin-point the exact same region/voxel in both datasets and understand what deformation the brain suffered from one time-point to another in all directions. Analyzing the detJac one can find whether a specific region of the brain suffered any local compression or expansion.<br/>With the registration results for any possible combination of data at hand, one can easily choose what to visualize and compare side by side: same subject-same modality-different time-points, different subjects-same modality-same time-points, same subject-different modalities-different time-points, different subjects-different modalities-same time-point, etc.<br/>In the proposed method the registration was performed using <code>elastix</code> [1] and the visualization interface was built using MeVisLab.<br/><b>Results:</b> The proposed approach was first tested using multi-modal follow-up data of 1 male Wistar rat (Harlan-Winkelmann). It was scanned repeatedly (every 2 months from 10 to 20 months of age) under 2% isoflurane anesthesia using a horizontal bore 11.7T Bruker BioSpec MRI scanner. Diffusion tensor imaging was used to calculate fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity and eigenvalue maps; a multislice multiecho experiment was performed to calculate T2 maps; both datasets were acquired with identical geometry and spatial resolution. T2*maps were acquired with a multi gradient echo sequence, angiography scans with a FLASH-2D TOF sequence with or without saturation of venous blood.<br/>It was used to identify and follow in time a spontaneous brain tumor growth, later identified ex vivo as a melingeom. The automatic linking of the same ROI/voxel in non-rigidly registered datasets and the use of the detJac to search for asymmetries in brain deformation allowed for a more accurate comparison of follow-up data.<br/><b>Conclusions:</b> In this work we describe the first step taken to build an interactive and intuitive to use exploration system for multi-modal longitudinal and cross-sectional studies. In the future, quantification tools will be added to the platform and an intensive validation will be performed with multi-modal life-span rat brain data.<br/><b>References:</b><br/>[1] Klein &amp; Staring <i>et al.</i>, "elastix: a toolbox for intensity based medical image registration," IEEE-TMI, 2010.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">Khmelinskii:2011</span><span class="p">,</span>

However, most pre-clinical research employs juvenile, 3 month old (300g) animals, which is not necessarily representative of the natural disease state.<br/>We are conducting a lifespan study on rats, imaging the juvenile development as well as ageing processes of the brain with non-invasive techniques including functional and anatomical MRI and different PET-tracers, respectively.<br/>An explorative study like this benefits from an automated evaluation technique that is based on individual structural changes rather than manual ROI analysis.<br/>To overcome this limitation, we used elastic coregistration and individual deformation fields to address changes in the frontal cortex from MR images.<br/><b>Material and Methods:</b> From postnatal day 21 two groups of four male Wistar rats were housed pairwise. Food restriction (80% of ad libitum consumption) started at months 3 in order to minimize obesity, a risk factor for age-related diseases [1].<br/>Animals were employed in MR experiments on a bimonthly basis. Group 1 was followed from the age of 3weeks up to 14 months, Group 2 from 10 until 20 months. MR experiments were conducted on an 11.7T Bruker BioSpec horizontal bore scanner. Animals were anaesthetized using 2% Isoflurane in 70:30 N2O:O2 and vital functions were monitored continuously.<br/>T2 maps were chosen for their anatomical detail and quantitative reproducibility. Maps were calculated from an MSME (multi slice multi echo) sequence (10echoes) with TE=10ms, TR=5000ms, FOV=28x28mm and a resolution of 0.146x0.146mm in plane and 0.5mm slice thickness (without gaps). For every individual all T2 maps from the different ages were coregistered non-rigidly using a B-spline transform [2], and the corresponding deformation fields calculated. Deformation maps indicated volumetric changes of brain regions.<br/>At specific time points (3 weeks and 3 months) a subset of rats was sacrificed for histological evaluation (cresyl violet).<br/><b>Results:</b> The deformation maps revealed a decrease in cortical thickness during juvenile development (3 weeks to 3 months). In parallel, quantitative evaluation of the frontal cortex showed a reduction of T2 relaxation time.<br/>A further T2 reduction was observed after the age of 6 months, however, without significant changes in volume. Preliminary histological evaluation revealed a higher cortical cell density at 3 months when compared to 3 weeks of age.<br/><b>Conclusions:</b> Elastic coregistration is a useful tool for lifespan studies, providing unbiased information on volume changes on an individual basis. The deformation fields allow the creation of physiologically meaningful ROIs for quantitative analysis of imaging parameters.<br/>A combination of reduced T2 and decreased cortical volume is implying an increasing tissue density (myelination and cell number) during development, lowering the relative amount of free water, and thus reducing the cortical volume. This was confirmed by histological evaluation.<br/><b>Acknowledgements:</b> This work was financially supported by BMBF (0314104) and ENCITE EU-FP7 (HEALTH-F5-2008-201842) program.<br/><b>References:</b><br/>[1] Mattson and Wan, Beneficial effect of intermittent fasting and caloric restriction on the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular systems, Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry, 16 (129-137), 2005.<br/>[2] Klein &amp; Staring <i>et al.</i>, "elastix: a toolbox for intensity based medical image registration," IEEE-TMI, 2010.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">Mengler:2011</span><span class="p">,</span>

Assessment of effect of new drugs for emphysema warrant local quantification of changes in severity of emphysema.<br/><b>Objectives:</b> To develop methods to locally evaluate emphysema progression.<br/><b>Methods:</b> Methods are based on matching follow-up chest CT scans using an intensity-based image registration technique, followed by subtracting baseline from follow-up images to estimate progression, while taking lung volume change into account. The first method assumes that lung mass is preserved and the second method is based on the observation that the volume-density slope is not necessarily fixed. The latter requires a third CT scan at a different inspiration level to estimate this slope locally. In a pilot study, both methods were applied to a lung phantom, where mass is known to be constant. Additionally, emphysema progression of three patients was graded visually by an MD, separately for apex, middle region and lung base, and these results were compared to the automatic methods.<br/><b>Results:</b> Both methods were able to reproduce the expected absence of progression in the phantom, the second method having the lowest error (mean error: 3.1 &pm; 5.8 HU and -0.2 &pm; 4.0 HU). Both methods showed good correspondence with the visual assessment, the second method being slightly better.<br/><b>Conclusions:</b> Image matching and the subsequent analysis of differences according to the proposed lung models is a potential tool for localizing emphysema progression in drug evaluation trials.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">Staring:2009</span><span class="p">,</span>

The goal in image registration is to find a coordinate mapping between a fixed target image and a moving source image. Until recently, machine learning was mainly used to aid image registration, e.g., for detecting misalignment. Nowadays, machine learning methods perform image registration themselves. In particular, deep learning-based image registration methods are gradually taking over the slow old methods. The benefit of machine learning-based image registration is that the spatial statistical relation between images are learned in an offline training phase. This means that during online inference time, image registration is performed very rapidly in one shot.

In this thesis, we developed automatic methods to quantify SSc disease, based on HRCT. In this thesis, we first provided a general introduction in Chapter 1 about pulmonary anatomy, SSc, PFTs, chest CT and deep learning on chest CT. A lung lobe segmentation method was proposed in Chapter 2, as accurately extracting lungs and lobes is an essential step for later SSc disease analysis. An explainable fully automated SSc-ILD scoring framework was proposed in Chapter 3. This framework could automatically select five levels and estimate the ratio of SSc-ILD to lung area for each level in the order of several seconds. In Chapter 4, an automatic PFT estimation network was developed which could help to understand the relation between lung function and structure and to estimate the PFTs from CT scans for patients with PFTs contraindications. Because of GPU memory limitation, the CT scans used in Chapter 4 were down-sampled. Therefore, Chapter 5 achieved higher PFT regression performance with less training time by converting vessel centerlines from HRCT to point cloud and graph data.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@phdthesis</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">Jia:2024</span><span class="p">,</span>

However, its clinical application is sometimes limited by the speed of the algorithm. For example, in online adaptive radiation therapy a few seconds is ideal, while it usually takes several minutes, at the least. In this thesis, we consider acceleration techniques for parametric intensity-based image registration problems focussing on the optimization routine, specifically the step size and the search direction. The different proposed methods are thoroughly evaluated on different datasets across modalities, subject, similarity measures and transformation models. Depending on the registration settings, the estimation time of the step size is reduced from 40 seconds to less than 1 second when the number of parameters is 105, almost 40 times faster. The total registration time of new acceleration techniques (FASGD) is reduced by a factor of 2.5-7x compared with ASGD for the experiments in this thesis. All methods were implemented using C++ in the open source registration package elastix. Based on these acceleration schemes we evaluated elastix on the application of automatic contour propagation in online adaptive intensity modulated proton therapy for prostate cancer.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@phdthesis</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">Qiao:2017</span><span class="p">,</span>

Functional information is provided by imaging modalities such as PET, SPECT and specialized MRI. Structural imaging modalities like radiography, CT, MRI and ultrasound provide detailed depictions of anatomy. Optical imaging modalities, such as BLI and near-infrared fluorescence imaging offer a high sensitivity in visualizing molecular processes in vivo. The combination of these modalities enables to follow the subject(s) and molecular processes in time, in living animals.<br/>With these advances in image acquisition, the problem has shifted from data acquisition to data processing. The organization, analysis and interpretation of this heterogeneous whole-body imaging data has become a demanding task.<br/>In this thesis, the data processing approach depicted in Figure 1.1 was further explored. This approach is based on an articulated whole-body atlas as a common reference to normalize the geometric heterogeneity caused by postural and anatomical differences between individuals and geometric differences between imaging modalities. Mapping to this articulated atlas has the advantage that all the different imaging modalities can be (semi) automatically registered to a common anatomical reference; postural variations can be corrected, and the different animals can be scaled properly while allowing for proper management of this highthroughput whole-body data.<br/>In this thesis, we have focused on three complementary aspects of the approach described in Figure 1.1, and worked towards an automated analysis pipeline for quantitative small animal image analysis. The specific goals of this thesis were:<ol type="i"><li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">to further generalize the articulated atlas-based registration method to the multi-modality component of the global approach presented in Figure 1.1, focusing on SPECT and MRI whole-body mouse data</li><li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">to expand the Articulated Planar Reformation algorithm by linking it to recently introduced resolution-enhancing MR reconstruction techniques which enable "zooming in" on small anatomical details not detectable with conventional MRI</li><li>to prove the added value of atlas-based analysis of multi-modal follow-up data in a life-science study of the ageing processes in the brain, with a specific focus on multi-contrast MR rat brain data</li></ol></p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@phdthesis</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">Khmelinskii:2013</span><span class="p">,</span>

Several methods are known to be instrumental for achieving this goal. This report considers one such method: digital watermarking, more specific quantization based watermarking methods. A general watermarking scheme consist of a watermark embedder, a channel representing some sort of processing on the watermarked signal, and a watermark detector. The problems related to any watermarking method are the perceptual quality of the watermarked signal, and the possibility to retrieve the embedded information at the detector.<br/>From current quantization based watermarking algorithms, like QIM, DC-QIM, SCS, etc., it is known that the achievable rates are promising, but that it is hard to meet the required robustness demands. Therefore improvements of current algorithms are sought that are more robust against normal processing. This report focusses on two possible improvements, namely the use of error correcting codes (ECC) and the use of adaptive quantization.<br/>Watermarking can be seen as a form of communication. Therefore, the robustness demand for watermarking is equivalent with the demand of reliable communication for communication models. Therefore, the use of ECC gives certainly an improvement in robustness. This is confirmed by experiments. Repetition codes are simple to implement and already gives a gain in robustness. The concatenation of convolutional codes with repetition codes gives an improvement only in the case of mild degradations due to the above mentioned processing.<br/>In this report watermarking of signals with a luminance component are considered, like digital images and video data. Adaptive quantization refers to the use of a larger quantization step size for high luminance values, and a lower quantization step size for low luminance values. It is known from Weber’s law that the human eye is less sensitive for brightness changes in higher luminance values, than it is in lower luminance values. Therefore, using adaptive quantization does not come at the cost of a loss of perceptual quality of the host signal. Adaptive quantization gives a large robustness gain for brightness scaling attacks. However, the adaptive quantization step size must be estimated at the detector, which potentially introduces an additional source of errors in the retrieved message. By means of experiments it is shown that this is not such a big problem. Therefore, adaptive quantization improves the robustness of the watermarking scheme.<br/>It is valuable to know the performance of the watermarking scheme with the two improvements. The used performance measure is the bit error probability. The total bit error probability is build up from two components: One estimates the bit error probability for the case of fixed quantization, with an Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) or uniform noise attack; The other estimates the bit error probability for the case of adaptive quantization, without any attack. Models for these two bit error probabilities are developed.<br/>At the embedder the distortion compensation parameter <i>&alpha;</i> has to be set. The optimal value for this parameter is derived for the case of a Gaussian host signal and an AWGN channel. The value of this optimal parameter <i>&alpha;*</i> is compared with an earlier result of Eggers and is shown to be identical. But whereas Eggers found a numerical function, which he numerically optimizes, our result leads to an analytical function, which can be optimized numerically.<br/>So, we use two methods to improve robustness, namely the use of error correcting codes and an adaptive quantization step size. These two methods are shown to be improvements. Also an analytical model for the performance is derived, which can be used to verify analytically the robustness improvement.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@mastersthesis</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">Staring:2002</span><span class="p">,</span>
