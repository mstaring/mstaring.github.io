  abstract={<b>Background and Purpose:</b> Retrospective dose evaluation for organ-at-risk auto-contours has previously used small cohorts due to additional manual effort required for treatment planning on auto-contours. We aimed to do this at large scale, by a) proposing and assessing an automated plan optimization workflow that used existing clinical plan parameters and b) using it for head-and-neck auto-contour dose evaluation.<br><b>Materials and Methods:</b> Our automated workflow emulated our clinic's treatment planning protocol and reused existing clinical plan optimization parameters. This workflow recreated the original clinical plan (POG) with manual contours (PMC) and evaluated the dose effect (POG - PMC) on 70 photon and 30 proton plans of head-and-neck patients. As a use-case, the same workflow (and parameters) created a plan using auto-contours (PAC) of eight head-and-neck organs-at-risk from a commercial tool and evaluated their dose effect (PMC - PAC).<br><b>Results:</b> For plan recreation (POG - PMC), our workflow had a median impact of 1.0% and 1.5% across dose metrics of auto-contours, for photon and proton respectively. Computer time of automated planning was 25% (photon) and 42% (proton) of manual planning time. For auto-contour evaluation (PMC - PAC), we noticed an impact of 2.0% and 2.6% for photon and proton radiotherapy. All evaluations had a median Î”NTCP (Normal Tissue Complication Probability) less than 0.3%.<br><b>Conclusions:</b> The plan replication capability of our automated program provides a blueprint for other clinics to perform auto-contour dose evaluation with large patient cohorts. Finally, despite geometric differences, auto-contours had a minimal median dose impact, hence inspiring confidence in their utility and facilitating their clinical adoption.}

  abstract={Artificial intelligence techniques, specifically deep learning, have already affected daily life in a wide range of areas. Likewise, initial applications have been explored in rheumatology. Deep learning might not easily surpass the accuracy of classic techniques when performing classification or regression on low-dimensional numerical data. With images as input, however, deep learning has become so successful that it has already outperformed the majority of conventional image-processing techniques developed during the past 50 years. As with any new imaging technology, rheumatologists and radiologists need to consider adapting their arsenal of diagnostic, prognostic and monitoring tools, and even their clinical role and collaborations. This adaptation requires a basic understanding of the technical background of deep learning, to efficiently utilize its benefits but also to recognize its drawbacks and pitfalls, as blindly relying on deep learning might be at odds with its capabilities. To facilitate such an understanding, it is necessary to provide an overview of deep-learning techniques for automatic image analysis in detecting, quantifying, predicting and monitoring rheumatic diseases, and of currently published deep-learning applications in radiological imaging for rheumatology, with critical assessment of possible limitations, errors and confounders, and conceivable consequences for rheumatologists and radiologists in clinical practice.}

  abstract = {Multi-sequence magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has found wide applications in both modern clinical studies and deep learning research. However, in clinical practice, it frequently occurs that one or more of the MRI sequences are missing due to different image acquisition protocols or contrast agent contraindications of patients, limiting the utilization of deep learning models trained on multi-sequence data. One promising approach is to leverage generative models to synthesize the missing sequences, which can serve as a surrogate acquisition. State-of-the-art methods tackling this problem are based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) which usually suffer from spectral biases, resulting in poor reconstruction of high-frequency fine details. In this paper, we propose Conditional Neural fields with Shift modulation (CoNeS), a model that takes voxel coordinates as input and learns a representation of the target images for multi-sequence MRI translation. The proposed model uses a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) instead of a CNN as the decoder for pixel-to-pixel mapping. Hence, each target image is represented as a neural field that is conditioned on the source image via shift modulation with a learned latent code. Experiments on BraTS 2018 and an in-house clinical dataset of vestibular schwannoma patients showed that the proposed method outperformed state-of-the-art methods for multi-sequence MRI translation both visually and quantitatively. Moreover, we conducted spectral analysis, showing that CoNeS was able to overcome the spectral bias issue common in conventional CNN models. To further evaluate the usage of synthesized images in clinical downstream tasks, we tested a segmentation network using the synthesized images at inference. The results showed that CoNeS improved the segmentation performance when some MRI sequences were missing and outperformed other synthesis models. We concluded that neural fields are a promising technique for multi-sequence MRI translation.},

  abstract = {Ensembles of contours arise in various applications like simulation, computer-aided design, and semantic segmentation. Uncovering ensemble patterns and analyzing individual members is a challenging task that suffers from clutter. Ensemble statistical summarization can alleviate this issue by permitting analyzing ensembles' distributional components like the mean and median, confidence intervals, and outliers. Contour boxplots, powered by Contour Band Depth (CBD), are a popular nonparametric ensemble summarization method that benefits from CBD's generality, robustness, and theoretical properties. In this work, we introduce Inclusion Depth (ID), a new notion of contour depth with three defining characteristics. First, ID is a generalization of functional Half-Region Depth, which offers several theoretical guarantees. Second, ID relies on a simple principle: the inside/outside relationships between contours. This facilitates implementing ID and understanding its results. Third, the computational complexity of ID scales quadratically in the number of members of the ensemble, improving CBD's cubic complexity. This also in practice speeds up the computation enabling the use of ID for exploring large contour ensembles or in contexts requiring multiple depth evaluations like clustering. In a series of experiments on synthetic data and case studies with meteorological and segmentation data, we evaluate ID's performance and demonstrate its capabilities for the visual analysis of contour ensembles.},

Even motion in the order of a millimeter can introduce severe blurring and ghosting artifacts, potentially necessitating re-acquisition. MRI can be accelerated by acquiring only a fraction of k-space, combined with advanced reconstruction techniques leveraging coil sensitivity profiles and prior knowledge. AI-based reconstruction techniques have recently been popularized, but generally assume an ideal setting without intra-scan motion.<br><b>Purpose:</b> To retrospectively detect and quantify the severity of motion artifacts in undersampled MRI data. This may prove valuable as a safety mechanism for AI-based approaches, provide useful information to the reconstruction method, or prompt for re-acquisition while the patient is still in the scanner.<br><b>Methods:</b> We developed a deep learning approach that detects and quantifies motion artifacts in undersampled brain MRI. We demonstrate that synthetically motion-corrupted data can be leveraged to train the CNN-based motion artifact estimator, generalizing well to real-world data. Additionally, we leverage the motion artifact estimator by using it as a selector for a motion-robust reconstruction model in case a considerable amount of motion was detected, and a high data consistency model otherwise.<br><b>Results:</b> Training and validation were performed on 4387 and 1304 synthetically motion-corrupted images and their uncorrupted counterparts, respectively. Testing was performed on undersampled in vivo motion-corrupted data from 28 volunteers, where our model distinguished head motion from motion-free scans with 91% and 96% accuracy when trained on synthetic and on real data, respectively. It predicted a manually defined quality label (`Good', `Medium' or `Bad' quality) correctly in 76% and 85% of the time when trained on synthetic and real data, respectively. When used as a selector it selected the appropriate reconstruction network 93% of the time, achieving near optimal SSIM values.<br><b>Conclusions:</b> The proposed method quantified motion artifact severity in undersampled MRI data with high accuracy, enabling real-time motion artifact detection that can help improve the safety and quality of AI-based reconstructions.},

  abstract = {Pulmonary function test (PFT) plays an important role in screening and following-up pulmonary involvement in systemic sclerosis (SSc). However, some patients are not able to perform PFT due to contraindications. In addition, it is unclear how lung function is affected by changes in lung structure in SSc. Therefore, this study aims to explore the potential of automatically estimating PFT results from chest CT scans of SSc patients and how different regions influence the estimation of PFT values. Deep regression networks were developed with transfer learning to estimate PFT from 316 SSc patients. Segmented lungs and vessels were used to mask the CT images to train the network with different inputs: from entire CT scan, lungs-only to vessels-only. The network trained by entire CT scans with transfer learning achieved an ICC of 0.71, 0.76, 0.80, and 0.81 for the estimation of DLCO, FEV1, FVC and TLC, respectively. The performance of the networks gradually decreased when trained on data from lungs-only and vessels-only. Regression attention maps showed that regions close to large vessels are highlighted more than other regions, and occasionally regions outside the lungs are highlighted. These experiments mean that apart from lungs and large vessels, other regions contribute to the estimation of PFTs. In addition, adding manually designed biomarkers increased the correlation (R) from 0.75, 0.74, 0.82, and 0.83 to 0.81, 0.83, 0.88, and 0.90, respectively. It means that that manually designed imaging biomarkers can still contribute to explaining the relation between lung function and structure.},

  abstract = {Background suppression (BGS) in arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI leads to a higher temporal SNR (tSNR) of the perfusion images compared to ASL without BGS. The performance of the BGS, however, depends on the tissue relaxation times and on inhomogeneities of the scanner's magnetic fields, which differ between subjects and are unknown at the moment of scanning. Therefore, we developed a feedback loop (FBL) mechanism that optimizes the BGS for each subject in the scanner during acquisition. We implemented the FBL for 2D pseudo-continuous ASL (PCASL) scans with an echo-planar imaging (EPI) readout. After each dynamic scan, acquired ASL images were automatically sent to an external computer and processed with a Python processing tool. Inversion times were optimized on-the-fly using 80 iterations of the Nelder-Mead method, by minimizing the signal intensity in the label image while maximizing the signal intensity in the perfusion image. The performance of this method was first tested in a 4-component phantom. The regularization parameter was then tuned in 6 healthy subjects (3 male, 3 female, age 24-62 years) and set as &lambda;=4 for all other experiments. Resulting ASL images, perfusion images and tSNR maps obtained from the last 20 iterations of the FBL scan were compared to those obtained without BGS and to standard BGS in 12 healthy volunteers (5 male, 7 female, age 24-62 years)  (including the 6 volunteers used for tuning of &lambda;). The FBL resulted in perfusion images with a statistically significantly higher tSNR (2.20) compared to standard BGS (1.96) (P < 5 10<sup>-3</sup>, two-sided paired t-test). Minimizing signal in the label image furthermore  resulted in control images from which approximate changes in perfusion signal can directly be appreciated. This could be relevant to ASL applications that require a high temporal resolution. Future work is needed to minimize the number of initial acquisitions during which the performance of BGS is reduced compared to standard BGS and to extend the technique to 3D ASL.},

Automating contouring leads to a faster workflow, which limits exposure to anesthesia and thereby, reducing its impact on experimental results and on animal wellbeing.

We trained the models only on native CTs and evaluated their performance using an independent testing dataset (i.e., native CTs not included in the training and validation). Unlike previous studies, we also tested the model performance on an external dataset (i.e., contrast-enhanced CTs) to see how well they predict on CTs completely different from what they were trained on. We also assessed the interobserver variability using the generalized conformity index (CIgen) among three observers, providing a stronger human baseline for evaluating automated contours than previous studies. Lastly, we showed the benefit on the contouring time compared to manual contouring. The results show that 3D models of nnU-Net achieve superior segmentation accuracy and are more robust to unseen data than 2D models. For all target organs, the mean surface distance (MSD) and the Hausdorff distance (95p HD) of the best performing model for this task (nnU-Net 3d_fullres) are within 0.16 mm and 0.60 mm, respectively. These values are below the minimum required contouring accuracy of 1 mm for small animal irradiations, and improve significantly upon state-of-the-art 2D U-Net-based AIMOS method. Moreover, the conformity indices of the 3d_fullres model also compare favourably to the interobserver variability for all target organs, whereas the 2D models perform poorly in this regard. Importantly, the 3d_fullres model offers 98% reduction in contouring time.},

  abstract = {Medical image registration and segmentation are two of the most frequent tasks in medical image analysis. As these tasks are complementary and correlated, it would be beneficial to apply them simultaneously in a joint manner. In this paper, we formulate registration and segmentation as a joint problem via a Multi-Task Learning (MTL) setting, allowing these tasks to leverage their strengths and mitigate their weaknesses through the sharing of beneficial information. We propose to merge these tasks not only on the loss level, but on the architectural level as well. We studied this approach in the context of adaptive image-guided radiotherapy for prostate cancer, where planning and follow-up CT images as well as their corresponding contours are available for training. At testing time the contours of the follow-up scans are not available, which is a common scenario in adaptive radiotherapy. The study involves two datasets from different manufacturers and institutes. The first dataset was divided into training (12 patients) and validation (6 patients), and was used to optimize and validate the methodology, while the second dataset (14 patients) was used as an independent test set. We carried out an extensive quantitative comparison between the quality of the automatically generated contours from different network architectures as well as loss weighting methods. Moreover, we evaluated the quality of the generated deformation vector field (DVF). We show that MTL algorithms outperform their Single-Task Learning (STL) counterparts and achieve better generalization on the independent test set. The best algorithm achieved a mean surface distance of 1.06&pm;0.3 mm, 1.27&pm;0.4 mm, 0.91&pm;0.4 mm, and 1.76&pm;0.8 mm on the validation set for the prostate, seminal vesicles, bladder, and rectum, respectively. The high accuracy of the proposed method combined with the fast inference speed, makes it a promising method for automatic re-contouring of follow-up scans for adaptive radiotherapy, potentially reducing treatment related complications and therefore improving patients quality-of-life after treatment.

  abstract = {Manual or automatic delineation of the esophageal tumor in CT images is known to be very challenging. This is due to the low contrast between the tumor and adjacent tissues, the anatomical variation of the esophagus, as well as the occasional presence of foreign bodies (e.g. feeding tubes). Physicians therefore usually exploit additional knowledge such as endoscopic findings, clinical history, additional imaging modalities like PET scans. Achieving his additional information is time-consuming, while the results are error-prone and might lead to non-deterministic results. In this paper we aim to investigate if and to what extent a simplified clinical workflow based on CT alone, allows one to automatically segment the esophageal tumor with sufficient quality. For this purpose, we present a fully automatic end-to-end esophageal tumor segmentation method based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The proposed network, called Dilated Dense Attention Unet (DDAUnet), leverages spatial and channel attention gates in each dense block to selectively concentrate on determinant feature maps and regions. Dilated convolutional layers are used to manage GPU memory and increase the network receptive field. We collected a dataset of 792 scans from 288 distinct patients including varying anatomies with air pockets, feeding tubes and proximal tumors. Repeatability and reproducibility studies were conducted for three distinct splits of training and validation sets. The proposed network achieved a DSC value of 0.79 &plusmn; 0.20, a mean surface distance of 5.4 &plusmn; 20.2mm and 95% Hausdorff distance of 14.7 &plusmn; 25.0mm for 287 test scans, demonstrating promising results with a simplified clinical workflow based on CT alone.

  abstract = {In this paper we propose a supervised method to predict registration misalignment using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This task is casted to a classification problem with multiple classes of misalignment: "correct" 0-3 mm, "poor" 3-6 mm and "wrong" over 6 mm. Rather than a direct prediction, we propose a hierarchical approach, where the prediction is gradually refined from coarse to fine. Our solution is based on a convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), using hierarchical misalignment predictions on three resolutions of the image pair, leveraging the intrinsic strengths of an LSTM for this problem. The convolutional LSTM is trained on a set of artificially generated image pairs obtained from artificial displacement vector fields (DVFs). Results on chest CT scans show that incorporating multi-resolution information, and the hierarchical use via an LSTM for this, leads to overall better F1 scores, with fewer misclassifications in a well-tuned registration setup. The final system yields an accuracy of 87.1%, and an average F1 score of 66.4% aggregated in two independent chest CT scan studies.},

This paper presents a framework for organ-specific image compression for teleinterventions based on a deep learning approach and anisotropic diffusion filter.|<b>Methods:</b> The proposed method, DLAD, uses a CNN architecture to extract a probability map for the organ of interest; this probability map guides an anisotropic diffusion filter that smooths the image except at the location of the organ of interest. Subsequently, a compression method, such as BZ2 and HEVC-visually lossless, is applied to compress the image. We demonstrate the proposed method on 3D CT images acquired for radio frequency ablation (RFA) of liver lesions. We quantitatively evaluate the proposed method on 151 CT images using peak-signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity (SSIM) and compression ratio (CR) metrics. Finally, we compare the assessments of two radiologists on the liver lesion detection and the liver lesion center annotation using 33 sets of the original images and the compressed images.|<b>Results:</b> The results show that the method can significantly improve CR of most well-known compression methods. DLAD combined with HEVC-visually lossless achieves the highest average CR of 6.45, which is 36% higher than that of the original HEVC and outperforms other state-of-the-art lossless medical image compression methods. The means of PSNR and SSIM are 70 dB and 0.95, respectively. In addition, the compression effects do not statistically significantly affect the assessments of the radiologists on the liver lesion detection and the lesion center annotation.|<b>Conclusions:</b> We thus conclude that the method has a high potential to be applied in teleintervention applications.},

In this work, we present the application of adaptive intelligence to accelerate MR acquisition. Starting from undersampled k-space data, an iterative learning-based reconstruction scheme inspired by compressed sensing theory is used to reconstruct the images. We developed a novel deep neural network to refine and correct prior reconstruction assumptions given the training data. The network was trained and tested on a knee MRI dataset from the 2019 fastMRI challenge organized by Facebook AI Research and NYU Langone Health. All submissions to the challenge were initially ranked based on similarity with a known groundtruth, after which the top 4 submissions were evaluated radiologically. Our method was evaluated by the fastMRI organizers on an independent challenge dataset. It ranked #1, shared #1, and #3 on respectively the 8x accelerated multi-coil, the 4x multi-coil, and the 4x single-coil tracks. This demonstrates the superior performance and wide applicability of the method.},

  abstract = {Imaging pulmonary fissures by CT provides useful information on diagnosis of pulmonary diseases. Automatic segmentation of fissures is a challenging task due to the variable appearance of fissures, such as inhomogeneous intensities, pathological deformation and imaging noise. To overcome these challenges, we propose an anisotropic differential operator called directional derivative of plate (DDoP) filter to probe the presence of fissure objects in 3D space by modeling the profile of a fissure patch with three parallel plates. To reduce the huge computation burden of dense matching with rotated DDoP kernels, a family of spherical harmonics are particularly utilized for acceleration. Additionally, a two-stage post-processing scheme is introduced to segment fissures. The performance of our method was verified in experiments using 55 scans from the publicly available LOLA11 dataset and 50 low-dose CT scans of lung cancer patients from the VIA-ELCAP database. Our method showed superior performance compared to the derivative of sticks (DoS) method and the Hessian-based method in terms of median and mean F1-score. The median F1-score for DDoP, DoS-based and Hessian-based methods on the LOLA11 dataset was 0.899, 0.848 and 0.843, respectively, and the mean F1-score was 0.858 &pm; 0.103, 0.781 &pm; 0.165 and 0.747 &pm; 0.239, respectively.},
