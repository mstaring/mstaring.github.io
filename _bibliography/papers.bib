  abstract = {The traditional Hessian-related vessel filters often suffer from detecting complex structures like bifurcations due to an over-simplified cylindrical model. To solve this problem, we present a shape-tuned strain energy density function to measure vessel likelihood in 3D medical images. This method is initially inspired by established stress-strain principles in mechanics. By considering the Hessian matrix as a stress tensor, the three invariants from orthogonal tensor decomposition are used independently or combined to formulate distinctive functions for vascular shape discrimination, brightness contrast and structure strengthen measuring. Moreover, a mathematical description of Hessian eigenvalues for general vessel shapes is obtained, based on an intensity continuity assumption, and a relative Hessian strength term is presented to ensure the dominance of second-order derivatives as well as suppress undesired step edges. Finally, we adopt the multi-scale scheme to find an optimal solution through scale space. The proposed method is validated in experiments with a digital phantom and non-contrast-enhanced pulmonary CT data. It is shown that our model performed more effectively in enhancing vessel bifurcations and preserving details, compared to three existing filters.},

  abstract = {Quantitative evaluation of image registration algorithms is a difficult and under-addressed issue due to the lack of a reference standard in most registration problems. In this work a method is presented whereby detailed reference standard data may be constructed in an efficient semi-automatic fashion. A well-distributed set of <i>n</i> landmarks is detected fully automatically in one scan of a pair to be registered. Using a custom-designed interface, observers define corresponding anatomic locations in the second scan for a specified subset of <i>s</i> of these landmarks. The remaining <i>n - s</i> landmarks are matched fully automatically by a thin-plate-spline based system using the <i>s</i> manual landmark correspondences to model the relationship between the scans. The method is applied to 47 pairs of temporal thoracic CT scans, three pairs of brain MR scans and five thoracic CT datasets with synthetic deformations. Interobserver differences are used to demonstrate the accuracy of the matched points. The utility of the reference standard data as a tool in evaluating registration is shown by the comparison of six sets of registration results on the 47 pairs of thoracic CT data.},

  abstract = {Thoracic computed tomography (CT) scans provide information about cardiovascular risk status. These scans are non-ECG-synchronized, thus precise quantification of coronary calcifications is difficult. Aortic calcium scoring is less sensitive to cardiac motion, so it is an alternative to coronary calcium scoring as an indicator of cardiovascular risk. We developed and evaluated a computer-aided system for automatic detection and quantification of aortic calcifications in low-dose non-contrast-enhanced chest CT. A computer-aided system for automatic detection and quantification of aortic calcifications was trained and tested on scans from participants of a lung cancer screening trial. A total of 433 low-dose, non-ECG-synchronized, non-contrast enhanced 16-detector row examinations of the chest were randomly divided into 340 training and 93 test data sets. A first observer manually identified aortic calcifications on training and test scans. A second observer did the same on the test scans only. First, a multi-atlas-based segmentation method was developed to delineate the aorta. Subsequently, the training data was used to train the system based on statistical pattern recognition theory to automatically identify calcifications in the aortic wall. Calcium volume scores for computer system and first observer and for the two observers were compared using descriptive statistics and Spearman rank correlation coefficients. The computer system correctly detected on average 768 mm<sup>3</sup> out of 871 mm<sup>3</sup> calcified plaque volume in the aorta with an average 61 mm<sup>3</sup> of false positive volume per scan. Spearman rank correlation coefficient was {\rho}=0.97 between system and first observer compared to {\rho}=0.99 between the two observers. Automatic calcium scoring in the aorta appears feasible with good correlation between manual and automatic scoring.},

  abstract = {Medical image registration is an important task in medical image processing. It refers to the process of aligning data sets, possibly from different modalities (e.g., magnetic resonance (MR) and computed tomography (CT)), different time points (e.g., follow-up scans), and/or different subjects (in case of population studies). A large number of methods for image registration are described in the literature. Unfortunately, there is not one method that works for all applications. We have therefore developed <code>elastix</code>, a publicly available computer program for intensity-based medical image registration. The software consists of a collection of algorithms that are commonly used to solve medical image registration problems. The modular design of <code>elastix</code> allows the user to quickly configure, test, and compare different registration methods for a specific application. The command-line interface enables automated processing of large numbers of data sets, by means of scripting. The usage of <code>elastix</code> for comparing different registration methods is illustrated with three example experiments, in which individual components of the registration method are varied.},

  abstract = {Atlas-based segmentation is a powerful generic technique for automatic delineation of structures in volumetric images. Several studies have shown that multi atlas segmentation methods outperform schemes that use only a single atlas, but running multiple registrations on volumetric data is time-consuming. Moreover, for many scans or regions within scans, a large number of atlases may not be required to achieve good segmentation performance and may even deteriorate the results. It would therefore be worthwhile to include the decision which and how many atlases to use for a particular target scan in the segmentation process. To this end, we propose two generally applicable multi atlas segmentation methods, AMAS and ALMAS. AMAS automatically selects the most appropriate atlases for a target image and automatically stops registering atlases when no further improvement is expected. ALMAS takes this concept one step further by locally deciding how many and which atlases are needed to segment a target image. The methods employ a computationally cheap atlas selection strategy, an automatic stopping criterion, and a technique to locally inspect registration results and determine how much improvement can be expected from further registrations.<br>AMAS and ALMAS were applied to segmentation of the heart in computed tomography scans of the chest and compared to a conventional multi atlas method (MAS). The results show that ALMAS achieves the same performance as MAS at a much lower computational cost. When the available segmentation time is fixed, both AMAS and ALMAS perform significantly better than MAS. In addition, AMAS was applied to an on-line segmentation challenge for delineation of the caudate nucleus in brain MRI scans where it achieved the best score of all results submitted to date.},

  abstract = {Radiation therapy for cervical cancer can benefit from image registration in several ways, for example by studying the motion of organs, or by (partially) automating the delineation of the target volume and other structures of interest. In this paper, the registration of cervical data is addressed using mutual information (MI) of not only image intensity, but also features that describe local image structure. Three aspects of the registration are addressed to make this approach feasible. Firstly, instead of relying on a histogram-based estimation of mutual information, which poses problems for a larger number of features, a graph-based implementation of {\alpha}-mutual information ({\alpha}-MI) is employed. Secondly, the analytical derivative of {\alpha}-MI is derived. This makes it possible to use a stochastic gradient descent method to solve the registration problem, which is substantially faster than non-derivative-based methods. Thirdly, the feature space is reduced by means of a principal component analysis, which also decreases the registration time. The proposed technique is compared to a standard approach, based on the mutual information of image intensity only. Experiments are performed on 93 T2-weighted MR clinical data sets acquired from 19 patients with cervical cancer. Several characteristics of the proposed algorithm are studied on a subset of 19 image pairs (one pair per patient). On the remaining data (36 image pairs, one or two pairs per patient) the median overlap is shown to improve significantly compared to standard MI from 0.85 to 0.86 for the clinical target volume (CTV, <i>p</i> = 2 10<sup>-2</sup>), from 0.75 to 0.81 for the bladder (<i>p</i> = 8 10<sup>-6</sup>) and from 0.76 to 0.77 for the rectum (<i>p</i> = 2 10<sup>-4</sup>). The registration error is improved at important tissue interfaces, such as that of the bladder with the CTV, and the interface of the rectum with the uterus and cervix.},

  abstract = {A novel atlas-based segmentation approach based on the combination of multiple registrations is presented. Multiple atlases are registered to a target image. To obtain a segmentation of the target, labels of the atlas images are propagated to it. The propagated labels are combined by spatially varying decision fusion weights. These weights are derived from local assessment of the registration success.  Furthermore, an atlas selection procedure is proposed that is equivalent to sequential forward selection from  statistical pattern recognition theory. The proposed method is compared to three existing atlas-based segmentation approaches, namely (1) single atlas-based segmentation, (2) average-shape atlas-based segmentation, and (3) multi-atlas-based segmentation with averaging as decision fusion. These methods were tested on the segmentation of the heart and the aorta in computed tomography scans of the thorax. The results show that the proposed method outperforms other methods and yields results very close to those of an independent human observer. Moreover, the additional atlas selection step led to a faster segmentation at a comparable performance.},

The method is based on the theoretical work by Plakhov and Cruz (2004). Our main methodological contribution is the derivation of an image-driven mechanism to select proper values for the most important free parameters of the method. The selection mechanism employs general characteristics of the cost functions that commonly occur in intensity-based image registration. Also, the theoretical convergence conditions of the optimisation method are taken into account. The proposed adaptive stochastic gradient descent (ASGD) method is compared to a standard, non-adaptive Robbins-Monro (RM) algorithm. Both ASGD and RM employ a stochastic subsampling technique to accelerate the optimisation process. Registration experiments were performed on 3D CT and MR data of the head, lungs, and prostate, using various similarity measures and transformation models. The results indicate that ASGD is robust to these variations in the registration framework and is less sensitive to the settings of the user-defined parameters than RM. The main disadvantage of RM is the need for a predetermined step size function. The ASGD method provides a solution for that issue.},

For every participant, one to three follow-up scans were available (total number of pairs, 84). Pairs of scans of the same nodule were registered nonrigidly, and then subtracted to enhance differences in size and density. Four observers rated size and density change of the GGO between pairs of scans by visual comparison alone and with additional availability of a subtraction image and indicated their confidence. An independent experienced chest radiologist served as an arbiter having all reader data, clinical data and follow-up examinations available. Nodule pairs for which the arbiter could not establish definite progression, regression, or stability were excluded from further evaluation. This left 59 and 58 pairs for evaluation of size and density change, respectively. Weighted kappa statistics were used to assess inter-observer agreement and agreement with the arbiter. Statistical significance was tested with a kappa z-test.<br><b>Results</b>: When the subtraction image was available, the average inter-observer improved from 0.52 to 0.66 for size change and from 0.47 to 0.57 for density change. Average agreement with the arbiter improved from 0.61 to 0.76 for size change and from 0.53 to 0.64 for density change. The effect was more pronounced when observer confidence without the subtraction image was low: agreement improved from 0.26 to 0.57 and from 0.19 to 0.47 in those cases.<br><b>Conclusions</b>: Image subtraction improves the evaluation of subtle changes in pulmonary ground-glass opacities and decreases inter-observer variability.},

  abstract = {An automatic method for delineating the prostate (including the seminal vesicles) in 3D magnetic resonance (MR) scans is presented. The method is based on nonrigid registration of a set of prelabelled atlas images. Each atlas image is nonrigidly registered with the target patient image. Subsequently, the deformed atlas label images are fused to yield a single segmentation of the patient image. The proposed method is evaluated on 50 clinical scans, which were manually segmented by three experts. The Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) is used to quantify the overlap between the automatic and manual segmentations. We investigate the impact of several factors on the performance of the segmentation method. For the registration, two similarity measures are compared: mutual information and a localised version of mutual information. The latter turns out to be superior (median diff. DSC = 0.02, p < 0.01 with a paired two-sided Wilcoxon test) and comes at no added computational cost, thanks to the use of a novel stochastic optimisation scheme. For the atlas fusion step we consider a majority voting rule and the ''simultaneous truth and performance level estimation'' (STAPLE) algorithm, both with and without a preceding atlas selection stage. The differences between the various fusion methods appear to be small and mostly not statistically significant (p > 0.05). To assess the influence of the atlas composition, two atlas sets are compared. The first set consists of 38 scans of healthy volunteers. The second set is constructed by a leave-one-out approach using the 50 clinical scans that are used for evaluation. The second atlas set gives substantially better performance (diff. DSC = 0.04, p < 0.01), stressing the importance of a careful atlas definition. With the best settings, a median DSC of around 0.85 is achieved, which is close to the median interobserver DSC of 0.87. The segmentation quality is especially good at the prostate-rectum interface, where the segmentation error remains below 1mm in 50% of the cases and below 1.5mm in 75% of the cases.},

Consequently, rigid tissue, such as bone, can be deformed elastically, growth of tumours may be concealed, and contrast-enhanced structures may be reduced in volume.<br>We propose a method to locally adapt the deformation field at structures that must be kept rigid, using a tissue-dependent filtering technique. This adaptive filtering of the deformation field results in locally linear transformations without scaling or shearing. The degree of filtering is related to tissue stiffness: more filtering is applied at stiff tissue locations, less at parts of the image containing nonrigid tissue. The tissue-dependent filter is incorporated in a commonly used registration algorithm, using mutual information as a similarity measure and cubic B-splines to model the deformation field. The new registration algorithm is compared with this popular method.<br>Evaluation of the proposed tissue-dependent filtering is performed on 3D CT data of the thorax and on 2D Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) images. The results show that tissue-dependent filtering of the deformation field leads to improved registration results: tumour volumes and vessel widths are preserved rather than affected.},

The coordinate mapping that relates the two images is found using an iterative optimization procedure. This work compares the performance of eight optimization methods: gradient descent (with two different step size selection algorithms), quasi-Newton, nonlinear conjugate gradient, Kiefer-Wolfowitz, simultaneous perturbation, Robbins-Monro, and evolution strategy. Special attention is paid to computation time reduction by using fewer voxels to calculate the cost function and its derivatives. The optimization methods are tested on manually deformed CT images of the heart, on follow-up CT chest scans, and on MR scans of the prostate acquired using a BFFE, T1, and T2 protocol. Registration accuracy is assessed by computing the overlap of segmented edges. Precision and convergence properties are studied by comparing deformation fields. The results show that the Robbins-Monro method is the best choice in most applications. With this approach, the computation time per iteration can be lowered approximately 500 times without affecting the rate of convergence by using a small subset of the image, randomly selected in every iteration, to compute the derivative of the mutual information. From the other methods the quasi-Newton and the nonlinear conjugate gradient method achieve a slightly higher precision, at the price of larger computation times.},

  abstract = {Medical images that are to be registered for clinical application often contain both structures that deform and ones that remain rigid. Nonrigid registration algorithms that do not model properties of different tissue types may result in deformations of rigid structures. In this article a local rigidity penalty term is proposed which is included in the registration function in order to penalize the deformation of rigid objects. This term can be used for any representation of the deformation field capable of modelling locally rigid transformations. By using a B-spline representation of the deformation field, a fast algorithm can be devised. The proposed method is compared with an unconstrained nonrigid registration algorithm. It is evaluated on clinical three-dimensional CT follow-up data of the thorax and on two-dimensional DSA image sequences. The results show that nonrigid registration using the proposed rigidity penalty term is capable of nonrigidly aligning images, while keeping user-defined structures locally rigid.},
