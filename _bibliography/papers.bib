  abstract = {<b>Background and Purpose:</b> Retrospective dose evaluation for organ-at-risk auto-contours has previously used small cohorts due to additional manual effort required for treatment planning on auto-contours. We aimed to do this at large scale, by a) proposing and assessing an automated plan optimization workflow that used existing clinical plan parameters and b) using it for head-and-neck auto-contour dose evaluation.<br><b>Materials and Methods:</b> Our automated workflow emulated our clinic's treatment planning protocol and reused existing clinical plan optimization parameters. This workflow recreated the original clinical plan (P<sub>OG</sub>) with manual contours (P<sub>MC</sub>) and evaluated the dose effect (P<sub>OG</sub> - P<sub>MC</sub>) on 70 photon and 30 proton plans of head-and-neck patients. As a use-case, the same workflow (and parameters) created a plan using auto-contours (P<sub>AC</sub>) of eight head-and-neck organs-at-risk from a commercial tool and evaluated their dose effect (P<sub>MC</sub> - P<sub>AC</sub>).<br><b>Results:</b> For plan recreation (P<sub>OG</sub> - P<sub>MC</sub>), our workflow had a median impact of 1.0% and 1.5% across dose metrics of auto-contours, for photon and proton respectively. Computer time of automated planning was 25% (photon) and 42% (proton) of manual planning time. For auto-contour evaluation (P<sub>MC</sub> - P<sub>AC</sub>), we noticed an impact of 2.0% and 2.6% for photon and proton radiotherapy. All evaluations had a median &Delta;NTCP (Normal Tissue Complication Probability) less than 0.3%.<br><b>Conclusions:</b> The plan replication capability of our automated program provides a blueprint for other clinics to perform auto-contour dose evaluation with large patient cohorts. Finally, despite geometric differences, auto-contours had a minimal median dose impact, hence inspiring confidence in their utility and facilitating their clinical adoption.}

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence techniques, specifically deep learning, have already affected daily life in a wide range of areas. Likewise, initial applications have been explored in rheumatology. Deep learning might not easily surpass the accuracy of classic techniques when performing classification or regression on low-dimensional numerical data. With images as input, however, deep learning has become so successful that it has already outperformed the majority of conventional image-processing techniques developed during the past 50 years. As with any new imaging technology, rheumatologists and radiologists need to consider adapting their arsenal of diagnostic, prognostic and monitoring tools, and even their clinical role and collaborations. This adaptation requires a basic understanding of the technical background of deep learning, to efficiently utilize its benefits but also to recognize its drawbacks and pitfalls, as blindly relying on deep learning might be at odds with its capabilities. To facilitate such an understanding, it is necessary to provide an overview of deep-learning techniques for automatic image analysis in detecting, quantifying, predicting and monitoring rheumatic diseases, and of currently published deep-learning applications in radiological imaging for rheumatology, with critical assessment of possible limitations, errors and confounders, and conceivable consequences for rheumatologists and radiologists in clinical practice.}

  abstract = {Multi-sequence magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has found wide applications in both modern clinical studies and deep learning research. However, in clinical practice, it frequently occurs that one or more of the MRI sequences are missing due to different image acquisition protocols or contrast agent contraindications of patients, limiting the utilization of deep learning models trained on multi-sequence data. One promising approach is to leverage generative models to synthesize the missing sequences, which can serve as a surrogate acquisition. State-of-the-art methods tackling this problem are based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) which usually suffer from spectral biases, resulting in poor reconstruction of high-frequency fine details. In this paper, we propose Conditional Neural fields with Shift modulation (CoNeS), a model that takes voxel coordinates as input and learns a representation of the target images for multi-sequence MRI translation. The proposed model uses a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) instead of a CNN as the decoder for pixel-to-pixel mapping. Hence, each target image is represented as a neural field that is conditioned on the source image via shift modulation with a learned latent code. Experiments on BraTS 2018 and an in-house clinical dataset of vestibular schwannoma patients showed that the proposed method outperformed state-of-the-art methods for multi-sequence MRI translation both visually and quantitatively. Moreover, we conducted spectral analysis, showing that CoNeS was able to overcome the spectral bias issue common in conventional CNN models. To further evaluate the usage of synthesized images in clinical downstream tasks, we tested a segmentation network using the synthesized images at inference. The results showed that CoNeS improved the segmentation performance when some MRI sequences were missing and outperformed other synthesis models. We concluded that neural fields are a promising technique for multi-sequence MRI translation.},
