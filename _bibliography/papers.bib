  abstract = {<b>Background and Purpose:</b> Retrospective dose evaluation for organ-at-risk auto-contours has previously used small cohorts due to additional manual effort required for treatment planning on auto-contours. We aimed to do this at large scale, by a) proposing and assessing an automated plan optimization workflow that used existing clinical plan parameters and b) using it for head-and-neck auto-contour dose evaluation.<br><b>Materials and Methods:</b> Our automated workflow emulated our clinic's treatment planning protocol and reused existing clinical plan optimization parameters. This workflow recreated the original clinical plan (P<sub>OG</sub>) with manual contours (P<sub>MC</sub>) and evaluated the dose effect (P<sub>OG</sub> - P<sub>MC</sub>) on 70 photon and 30 proton plans of head-and-neck patients. As a use-case, the same workflow (and parameters) created a plan using auto-contours (P<sub>AC</sub>) of eight head-and-neck organs-at-risk from a commercial tool and evaluated their dose effect (P<sub>MC</sub> - P<sub>AC</sub>).<br><b>Results:</b> For plan recreation (P<sub>OG</sub> - P<sub>MC</sub>), our workflow had a median impact of 1.0% and 1.5% across dose metrics of auto-contours, for photon and proton respectively. Computer time of automated planning was 25% (photon) and 42% (proton) of manual planning time. For auto-contour evaluation (P<sub>MC</sub> - P<sub>AC</sub>), we noticed an impact of 2.0% and 2.6% for photon and proton radiotherapy. All evaluations had a median &Delta;NTCP (Normal Tissue Complication Probability) less than 0.3%.<br><b>Conclusions:</b> The plan replication capability of our automated program provides a blueprint for other clinics to perform auto-contour dose evaluation with large patient cohorts. Finally, despite geometric differences, auto-contours had a minimal median dose impact, hence inspiring confidence in their utility and facilitating their clinical adoption.}

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence techniques, specifically deep learning, have already affected daily life in a wide range of areas. Likewise, initial applications have been explored in rheumatology. Deep learning might not easily surpass the accuracy of classic techniques when performing classification or regression on low-dimensional numerical data. With images as input, however, deep learning has become so successful that it has already outperformed the majority of conventional image-processing techniques developed during the past 50 years. As with any new imaging technology, rheumatologists and radiologists need to consider adapting their arsenal of diagnostic, prognostic and monitoring tools, and even their clinical role and collaborations. This adaptation requires a basic understanding of the technical background of deep learning, to efficiently utilize its benefits but also to recognize its drawbacks and pitfalls, as blindly relying on deep learning might be at odds with its capabilities. To facilitate such an understanding, it is necessary to provide an overview of deep-learning techniques for automatic image analysis in detecting, quantifying, predicting and monitoring rheumatic diseases, and of currently published deep-learning applications in radiological imaging for rheumatology, with critical assessment of possible limitations, errors and confounders, and conceivable consequences for rheumatologists and radiologists in clinical practice.}

  abstract = {Multi-sequence magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has found wide applications in both modern clinical studies and deep learning research. However, in clinical practice, it frequently occurs that one or more of the MRI sequences are missing due to different image acquisition protocols or contrast agent contraindications of patients, limiting the utilization of deep learning models trained on multi-sequence data. One promising approach is to leverage generative models to synthesize the missing sequences, which can serve as a surrogate acquisition. State-of-the-art methods tackling this problem are based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) which usually suffer from spectral biases, resulting in poor reconstruction of high-frequency fine details. In this paper, we propose Conditional Neural fields with Shift modulation (CoNeS), a model that takes voxel coordinates as input and learns a representation of the target images for multi-sequence MRI translation. The proposed model uses a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) instead of a CNN as the decoder for pixel-to-pixel mapping. Hence, each target image is represented as a neural field that is conditioned on the source image via shift modulation with a learned latent code. Experiments on BraTS 2018 and an in-house clinical dataset of vestibular schwannoma patients showed that the proposed method outperformed state-of-the-art methods for multi-sequence MRI translation both visually and quantitatively. Moreover, we conducted spectral analysis, showing that CoNeS was able to overcome the spectral bias issue common in conventional CNN models. To further evaluate the usage of synthesized images in clinical downstream tasks, we tested a segmentation network using the synthesized images at inference. The results showed that CoNeS improved the segmentation performance when some MRI sequences were missing and outperformed other synthesis models. We concluded that neural fields are a promising technique for multi-sequence MRI translation.},

  abstract = {Ensembles of contours arise in various applications like simulation, computer-aided design, and semantic segmentation. Uncovering ensemble patterns and analyzing individual members is a challenging task that suffers from clutter. Ensemble statistical summarization can alleviate this issue by permitting analyzing ensembles' distributional components like the mean and median, confidence intervals, and outliers. Contour boxplots, powered by Contour Band Depth (CBD), are a popular nonparametric ensemble summarization method that benefits from CBD's generality, robustness, and theoretical properties. In this work, we introduce Inclusion Depth (ID), a new notion of contour depth with three defining characteristics. First, ID is a generalization of functional Half-Region Depth, which offers several theoretical guarantees. Second, ID relies on a simple principle: the inside/outside relationships between contours. This facilitates implementing ID and understanding its results. Third, the computational complexity of ID scales quadratically in the number of members of the ensemble, improving CBD's cubic complexity. This also in practice speeds up the computation enabling the use of ID for exploring large contour ensembles or in contexts requiring multiple depth evaluations like clustering. In a series of experiments on synthetic data and case studies with meteorological and segmentation data, we evaluate ID's performance and demonstrate its capabilities for the visual analysis of contour ensembles.},

  abstract = {<b>Background:</b> MR acquisition is a time consuming process, making it susceptible to patient motion during scanning. Even motion in the order of a millimeter can introduce severe blurring and ghosting artifacts, potentially necessitating re-acquisition. MRI can be accelerated by acquiring only a fraction of k-space, combined with advanced reconstruction techniques leveraging coil sensitivity profiles and prior knowledge. AI-based reconstruction techniques have recently been popularized, but generally assume an ideal setting without intra-scan motion.<br><b>Purpose:</b> To retrospectively detect and quantify the severity of motion artifacts in undersampled MRI data. This may prove valuable as a safety mechanism for AI-based approaches, provide useful information to the reconstruction method, or prompt for re-acquisition while the patient is still in the scanner.<br><b>Methods:</b> We developed a deep learning approach that detects and quantifies motion artifacts in undersampled brain MRI. We demonstrate that synthetically motion-corrupted data can be leveraged to train the CNN-based motion artifact estimator, generalizing well to real-world data. Additionally, we leverage the motion artifact estimator by using it as a selector for a motion-robust reconstruction model in case a considerable amount of motion was detected, and a high data consistency model otherwise.<br><b>Results:</b> Training and validation were performed on 4387 and 1304 synthetically motion-corrupted images and their uncorrupted counterparts, respectively. Testing was performed on undersampled in vivo motion-corrupted data from 28 volunteers, where our model distinguished head motion from motion-free scans with 91% and 96% accuracy when trained on synthetic and on real data, respectively. It predicted a manually defined quality label (`Good', `Medium' or `Bad' quality) correctly in 76% and 85% of the time when trained on synthetic and real data, respectively. When used as a selector it selected the appropriate reconstruction network 93% of the time, achieving near optimal SSIM values.<br><b>Conclusions:</b> The proposed method quantified motion artifact severity in undersampled MRI data with high accuracy, enabling real-time motion artifact detection that can help improve the safety and quality of AI-based reconstructions.},

  abstract = {Pulmonary function test (PFT) plays an important role in screening and following-up pulmonary involvement in systemic sclerosis (SSc). However, some patients are not able to perform PFT due to contraindications. In addition, it is unclear how lung function is affected by changes in lung structure in SSc. Therefore, this study aims to explore the potential of automatically estimating PFT results from chest CT scans of SSc patients and how different regions influence the estimation of PFT values. Deep regression networks were developed with transfer learning to estimate PFT from 316 SSc patients. Segmented lungs and vessels were used to mask the CT images to train the network with different inputs: from entire CT scan, lungs-only to vessels-only. The network trained by entire CT scans with transfer learning achieved an ICC of 0.71, 0.76, 0.80, and 0.81 for the estimation of DLCO, FEV1, FVC and TLC, respectively. The performance of the networks gradually decreased when trained on data from lungs-only and vessels-only. Regression attention maps showed that regions close to large vessels are highlighted more than other regions, and occasionally regions outside the lungs are highlighted. These experiments mean that apart from lungs and large vessels, other regions contribute to the estimation of PFTs. In addition, adding manually designed biomarkers increased the correlation (R) from 0.75, 0.74, 0.82, and 0.83 to 0.81, 0.83, 0.88, and 0.90, respectively. It means that that manually designed imaging biomarkers can still contribute to explaining the relation between lung function and structure.},

Comparing the automated to human measurements resulted in ICC of 0.98 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.974; 0.987) and 0.97 (95% CI: 0.968; 0.984), with limits of agreement of 2.2 and 2.1 mm for diameters parallel and perpendicular to the posterior side of the temporal bone, respectively. There was satisfactory agreement on tumor progression between automated measurements and human observers (Cohen's &kappa; = 0.77), better than the agreement between the human observers (Cohen's &kappa; = 0.74).<br><b>Conclusion.</b> Automated 2D diameter measurements and growth detection of vestibular schwannomas are at least as accurate as human 2D measurements. In clinical practice, measurements of the maximal extrameatal tumor (2D) diameters of vestibular schwannomas provide important complementary information to total tumor volume (3D) measurements. Combining both in an automated measurement algorithm facilitates clinical adoption.},

Therefore, we evaluated whether pulmonary vascular morphology and densitometry using CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) in arteries and veins could distinguish PE from CTEPH.<br>We analyzed CTPA images from a convenience cohort of 16 PE patients, 6 CTEPH patients and 15 controls without PE or CTEPH. Pulmonary vessels were extracted with a graph-cuts method, and separated into arteries and veins using a deep-learning classification method. By analyzing the distribution of vessel radii, vascular morphology was quantified into a slope (&alpha;) and intercept (&beta;) for the entire pulmonary vascular tree, and for arteries and veins, separately. To quantify lung perfusion, the median pulmonary vascular density was calculated. As a reference, lung perfusion was also quantified by the contrast enhancement in the parenchymal areas, pulmonary trunk and descending aorta. All quantifications were compared between the three groups.<br>Vascular morphology did not differ between groups, in contrast to vascular density values (both arterial and venous; p-values 0.006 - 0.014). The median vascular density (interquartile range) was -452 (95), -567 (113) and -470 (323) HU, for the PE, control and CTEPH group, respectively. The perfusion curves from all measurements showed different patterns between groups.<br>In this proof of concept study, not vasculature morphology but vascular densities differentiated between normal and thrombotic obstructed vasculature. For distinction on an individual patient level, further technical improvements are needed both in terms of image acquisition/reconstruction and post-processing.},
