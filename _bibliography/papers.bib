  abstract = {The contour depth methodology enables non-parametric summarization of contour ensembles by extracting their representatives, confidence bands, and outliers for visualization (via contour boxplots) and robust downstream procedures. We address two shortcomings of these methods. Firstly, we significantly expedite the computation and recomputation of Inclusion Depth (ID), introducing a linear-time algorithm for epsilon ID, a variant used for handling ensembles with contours with multiple intersections. We also present the inclusion matrix, which contains the pairwise inclusion relationships between contours, and leverage it to accelerate the recomputation of ID. Secondly, extending beyond the single distribution assumption, we present the Relative Depth (ReD), a generalization of contour depth for ensembles with multiple modes. Building upon the linear-time eID, we introduce CDclust, a clustering algorithm that untangles ensemble modes of variation by optimizing ReD. Synthetic and real datasets from medical image segmentation and meteorological forecasting showcase the speed advantages, illustrate the use case of progressive depth computation and enable non-parametric multimodal analysis. To promote research and adoption, we offer the contour-depth Python package.},

We aimed to do this at large scale, by a) proposing and assessing an automated plan optimization workflow that used existing clinical plan parameters and b) using it for head-and-neck auto-contour dose evaluation.<br><b>Materials and Methods:</b> Our automated workflow emulated our clinic's treatment planning protocol and reused existing clinical plan optimization parameters. This workflow recreated the original clinical plan (P<sub>OG</sub>) with manual contours (P<sub>MC</sub>) and evaluated the dose effect (P<sub>OG</sub> - P<sub>MC</sub>) on 70 photon and 30 proton plans of head-and-neck patients. As a use-case, the same workflow (and parameters) created a plan using auto-contours (P<sub>AC</sub>) of eight head-and-neck organs-at-risk from a commercial tool and evaluated their dose effect (P<sub>MC</sub> - P<sub>AC</sub>).<br><b>Results:</b> For plan recreation (P<sub>OG</sub> - P<sub>MC</sub>), our workflow had a median impact of 1.0% and 1.5% across dose metrics of auto-contours, for photon and proton respectively. Computer time of automated planning was 25% (photon) and 42% (proton) of manual planning time. For auto-contour evaluation (P<sub>MC</sub> - P<sub>AC</sub>), we noticed an impact of 2.0% and 2.6% for photon and proton radiotherapy. All evaluations had a median &Delta;NTCP (Normal Tissue Complication Probability) less than 0.3%.<br><b>Conclusions:</b> The plan replication capability of our automated program provides a blueprint for other clinics to perform auto-contour dose evaluation with large patient cohorts. Finally, despite geometric differences, auto-contours had a minimal median dose impact, hence inspiring confidence in their utility and facilitating their clinical adoption.}

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence techniques, specifically deep learning, have already affected daily life in a wide range of areas. Likewise, initial applications have been explored in rheumatology. Deep learning might not easily surpass the accuracy of classic techniques when performing classification or regression on low-dimensional numerical data. With images as input, however, deep learning has become so successful that it has already outperformed the majority of conventional image-processing techniques developed during the past 50 years. As with any new imaging technology, rheumatologists and radiologists need to consider adapting their arsenal of diagnostic, prognostic and monitoring tools, and even their clinical role and collaborations. This adaptation requires a basic understanding of the technical background of deep learning, to efficiently utilize its benefits but also to recognize its drawbacks and pitfalls, as blindly relying on deep learning might be at odds with its capabilities. To facilitate such an understanding, it is necessary to provide an overview of deep-learning techniques for automatic image analysis in detecting, quantifying, predicting and monitoring rheumatic diseases, and of currently published deep-learning applications in radiological imaging for rheumatology, with critical assessment of possible limitations, errors and confounders, and conceivable consequences for rheumatologists and radiologists in clinical practice.}

  abstract = {Multi-sequence magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has found wide applications in both modern clinical studies and deep learning research. However, in clinical practice, it frequently occurs that one or more of the MRI sequences are missing due to different image acquisition protocols or contrast agent contraindications of patients, limiting the utilization of deep learning models trained on multi-sequence data. One promising approach is to leverage generative models to synthesize the missing sequences, which can serve as a surrogate acquisition. State-of-the-art methods tackling this problem are based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) which usually suffer from spectral biases, resulting in poor reconstruction of high-frequency fine details. In this paper, we propose Conditional Neural fields with Shift modulation (CoNeS), a model that takes voxel coordinates as input and learns a representation of the target images for multi-sequence MRI translation. The proposed model uses a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) instead of a CNN as the decoder for pixel-to-pixel mapping. Hence, each target image is represented as a neural field that is conditioned on the source image via shift modulation with a learned latent code. Experiments on BraTS 2018 and an in-house clinical dataset of vestibular schwannoma patients showed that the proposed method outperformed state-of-the-art methods for multi-sequence MRI translation both visually and quantitatively. Moreover, we conducted spectral analysis, showing that CoNeS was able to overcome the spectral bias issue common in conventional CNN models. To further evaluate the usage of synthesized images in clinical downstream tasks, we tested a segmentation network using the synthesized images at inference. The results showed that CoNeS improved the segmentation performance when some MRI sequences were missing and outperformed other synthesis models. We concluded that neural fields are a promising technique for multi-sequence MRI translation.},

  abstract = {Ensembles of contours arise in various applications like simulation, computer-aided design, and semantic segmentation. Uncovering ensemble patterns and analyzing individual members is a challenging task that suffers from clutter. Ensemble statistical summarization can alleviate this issue by permitting analyzing ensembles' distributional components like the mean and median, confidence intervals, and outliers. Contour boxplots, powered by Contour Band Depth (CBD), are a popular nonparametric ensemble summarization method that benefits from CBD's generality, robustness, and theoretical properties. In this work, we introduce Inclusion Depth (ID), a new notion of contour depth with three defining characteristics. First, ID is a generalization of functional Half-Region Depth, which offers several theoretical guarantees. Second, ID relies on a simple principle: the inside/outside relationships between contours. This facilitates implementing ID and understanding its results. Third, the computational complexity of ID scales quadratically in the number of members of the ensemble, improving CBD's cubic complexity. This also in practice speeds up the computation enabling the use of ID for exploring large contour ensembles or in contexts requiring multiple depth evaluations like clustering. In a series of experiments on synthetic data and case studies with meteorological and segmentation data, we evaluate ID's performance and demonstrate its capabilities for the visual analysis of contour ensembles.},

Even motion in the order of a millimeter can introduce severe blurring and ghosting artifacts, potentially necessitating re-acquisition. MRI can be accelerated by acquiring only a fraction of k-space, combined with advanced reconstruction techniques leveraging coil sensitivity profiles and prior knowledge. AI-based reconstruction techniques have recently been popularized, but generally assume an ideal setting without intra-scan motion.<br><b>Purpose:</b> To retrospectively detect and quantify the severity of motion artifacts in undersampled MRI data. This may prove valuable as a safety mechanism for AI-based approaches, provide useful information to the reconstruction method, or prompt for re-acquisition while the patient is still in the scanner.<br><b>Methods:</b> We developed a deep learning approach that detects and quantifies motion artifacts in undersampled brain MRI. We demonstrate that synthetically motion-corrupted data can be leveraged to train the CNN-based motion artifact estimator, generalizing well to real-world data. Additionally, we leverage the motion artifact estimator by using it as a selector for a motion-robust reconstruction model in case a considerable amount of motion was detected, and a high data consistency model otherwise.<br><b>Results:</b> Training and validation were performed on 4387 and 1304 synthetically motion-corrupted images and their uncorrupted counterparts, respectively. Testing was performed on undersampled in vivo motion-corrupted data from 28 volunteers, where our model distinguished head motion from motion-free scans with 91% and 96% accuracy when trained on synthetic and on real data, respectively. It predicted a manually defined quality label (`Good', `Medium' or `Bad' quality) correctly in 76% and 85% of the time when trained on synthetic and real data, respectively. When used as a selector it selected the appropriate reconstruction network 93% of the time, achieving near optimal SSIM values.<br><b>Conclusions:</b> The proposed method quantified motion artifact severity in undersampled MRI data with high accuracy, enabling real-time motion artifact detection that can help improve the safety and quality of AI-based reconstructions.},

  abstract = {Pulmonary function test (PFT) plays an important role in screening and following-up pulmonary involvement in systemic sclerosis (SSc). However, some patients are not able to perform PFT due to contraindications. In addition, it is unclear how lung function is affected by changes in lung structure in SSc. Therefore, this study aims to explore the potential of automatically estimating PFT results from chest CT scans of SSc patients and how different regions influence the estimation of PFT values. Deep regression networks were developed with transfer learning to estimate PFT from 316 SSc patients. Segmented lungs and vessels were used to mask the CT images to train the network with different inputs: from entire CT scan, lungs-only to vessels-only. The network trained by entire CT scans with transfer learning achieved an ICC of 0.71, 0.76, 0.80, and 0.81 for the estimation of DLCO, FEV1, FVC and TLC, respectively. The performance of the networks gradually decreased when trained on data from lungs-only and vessels-only. Regression attention maps showed that regions close to large vessels are highlighted more than other regions, and occasionally regions outside the lungs are highlighted. These experiments mean that apart from lungs and large vessels, other regions contribute to the estimation of PFTs. In addition, adding manually designed biomarkers increased the correlation (R) from 0.75, 0.74, 0.82, and 0.83 to 0.81, 0.83, 0.88, and 0.90, respectively. It means that that manually designed imaging biomarkers can still contribute to explaining the relation between lung function and structure.},

  abstract = {Background suppression (BGS) in arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI leads to a higher temporal SNR (tSNR) of the perfusion images compared to ASL without BGS. The performance of the BGS, however, depends on the tissue relaxation times and on inhomogeneities of the scanner's magnetic fields, which differ between subjects and are unknown at the moment of scanning. Therefore, we developed a feedback loop (FBL) mechanism that optimizes the BGS for each subject in the scanner during acquisition. We implemented the FBL for 2D pseudo-continuous ASL (PCASL) scans with an echo-planar imaging (EPI) readout. After each dynamic scan, acquired ASL images were automatically sent to an external computer and processed with a Python processing tool. Inversion times were optimized on-the-fly using 80 iterations of the Nelder-Mead method, by minimizing the signal intensity in the label image while maximizing the signal intensity in the perfusion image. The performance of this method was first tested in a 4-component phantom. The regularization parameter was then tuned in 6 healthy subjects (3 male, 3 female, age 24-62 years) and set as &lambda;=4 for all other experiments. Resulting ASL images, perfusion images and tSNR maps obtained from the last 20 iterations of the FBL scan were compared to those obtained without BGS and to standard BGS in 12 healthy volunteers (5 male, 7 female, age 24-62 years)  (including the 6 volunteers used for tuning of &lambda;). The FBL resulted in perfusion images with a statistically significantly higher tSNR (2.20) compared to standard BGS (1.96) (P < 5 10<sup>-3</sup>, two-sided paired t-test). Minimizing signal in the label image furthermore  resulted in control images from which approximate changes in perfusion signal can directly be appreciated. This could be relevant to ASL applications that require a high temporal resolution. Future work is needed to minimize the number of initial acquisitions during which the performance of BGS is reduced compared to standard BGS and to extend the technique to 3D ASL.},

Errors in peak local SAR obtained were below 3.0% in the quadrature birdcage. Results obtained in the PTx configuration indicated that a safety margin of 6.3% ensures conservative local SAR estimates in 95% of the random RF shims, compared to an average overestimation of 34% in the generic "one-size-fits-all" approach.<br><b>Conclusion.</b> A subject-specific body model can be automatically generated from a single T1-weighted dataset by means of deep learning, providing the necessary inputs for accurate and personalized local SAR predictions in PTx neuroimaging at 7T.},

  abstract = {For image-guided small animal irradiations, the whole workflow of imaging, organ contouring, irradiation planning, and delivery is typically performed in a single session requiring continuous administration of anesthetic agents. Automating contouring leads to a faster workflow, which limits exposure to anesthesia and thereby, reducing its impact on experimental results and on animal wellbeing. Here, we trained the 2D and 3D U-Net architectures of no-new-Net (nnU-Net) for autocontouring of the thorax in mouse micro-CT images. We trained the models only on native CTs and evaluated their performance using an independent testing dataset (i.e., native CTs not included in the training and validation). Unlike previous studies, we also tested the model performance on an external dataset (i.e., contrast-enhanced CTs) to see how well they predict on CTs completely different from what they were trained on. We also assessed the interobserver variability using the generalized conformity index (CIgen) among three observers, providing a stronger human baseline for evaluating automated contours than previous studies. Lastly, we showed the benefit on the contouring time compared to manual contouring. The results show that 3D models of nnU-Net achieve superior segmentation accuracy and are more robust to unseen data than 2D models. For all target organs, the mean surface distance (MSD) and the Hausdorff distance (95p HD) of the best performing model for this task (nnU-Net 3d_fullres) are within 0.16 mm and 0.60 mm, respectively. These values are below the minimum required contouring accuracy of 1 mm for small animal irradiations, and improve significantly upon state-of-the-art 2D U-Net-based AIMOS method. Moreover, the conformity indices of the 3d_fullres model also compare favourably to the interobserver variability for all target organs, whereas the 2D models perform poorly in this regard. Importantly, the 3d_fullres model offers 98% reduction in contouring time.},

  abstract = {Medical image registration and segmentation are two of the most frequent tasks in medical image analysis. As these tasks are complementary and correlated, it would be beneficial to apply them simultaneously in a joint manner. In this paper, we formulate registration and segmentation as a joint problem via a Multi-Task Learning (MTL) setting, allowing these tasks to leverage their strengths and mitigate their weaknesses through the sharing of beneficial information. We propose to merge these tasks not only on the loss level, but on the architectural level as well. We studied this approach in the context of adaptive image-guided radiotherapy for prostate cancer, where planning and follow-up CT images as well as their corresponding contours are available for training. At testing time the contours of the follow-up scans are not available, which is a common scenario in adaptive radiotherapy. The study involves two datasets from different manufacturers and institutes. The first dataset was divided into training (12 patients) and validation (6 patients), and was used to optimize and validate the methodology, while the second dataset (14 patients) was used as an independent test set. We carried out an extensive quantitative comparison between the quality of the automatically generated contours from different network architectures as well as loss weighting methods. Moreover, we evaluated the quality of the generated deformation vector field (DVF). We show that MTL algorithms outperform their Single-Task Learning (STL) counterparts and achieve better generalization on the independent test set. The best algorithm achieved a mean surface distance of 1.06&pm;0.3 mm, 1.27&pm;0.4 mm, 0.91&pm;0.4 mm, and 1.76&pm;0.8 mm on the validation set for the prostate, seminal vesicles, bladder, and rectum, respectively. The high accuracy of the proposed method combined with the fast inference speed, makes it a promising method for automatic re-contouring of follow-up scans for adaptive radiotherapy, potentially reducing treatment related complications and therefore improving patients quality-of-life after treatment.

  abstract = {Manual or automatic delineation of the esophageal tumor in CT images is known to be very challenging. This is due to the low contrast between the tumor and adjacent tissues, the anatomical variation of the esophagus, as well as the occasional presence of foreign bodies (e.g. feeding tubes). Physicians therefore usually exploit additional knowledge such as endoscopic findings, clinical history, additional imaging modalities like PET scans. Achieving his additional information is time-consuming, while the results are error-prone and might lead to non-deterministic results. In this paper we aim to investigate if and to what extent a simplified clinical workflow based on CT alone, allows one to automatically segment the esophageal tumor with sufficient quality. For this purpose, we present a fully automatic end-to-end esophageal tumor segmentation method based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The proposed network, called Dilated Dense Attention Unet (DDAUnet), leverages spatial and channel attention gates in each dense block to selectively concentrate on determinant feature maps and regions. Dilated convolutional layers are used to manage GPU memory and increase the network receptive field. We collected a dataset of 792 scans from 288 distinct patients including varying anatomies with air pockets, feeding tubes and proximal tumors. Repeatability and reproducibility studies were conducted for three distinct splits of training and validation sets. The proposed network achieved a DSC value of 0.79 &plusmn; 0.20, a mean surface distance of 5.4 &plusmn; 20.2mm and 95% Hausdorff distance of 14.7 &plusmn; 25.0mm for 287 test scans, demonstrating promising results with a simplified clinical workflow based on CT alone.

This task is casted to a classification problem with multiple classes of misalignment: "correct" 0-3 mm, "poor" 3-6 mm and "wrong" over 6 mm. Rather than a direct prediction, we propose a hierarchical approach, where the prediction is gradually refined from coarse to fine. Our solution is based on a convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), using hierarchical misalignment predictions on three resolutions of the image pair, leveraging the intrinsic strengths of an LSTM for this problem. The convolutional LSTM is trained on a set of artificially generated image pairs obtained from artificial displacement vector fields (DVFs). Results on chest CT scans show that incorporating multi-resolution information, and the hierarchical use via an LSTM for this, leads to overall better F1 scores, with fewer misclassifications in a well-tuned registration setup. The final system yields an accuracy of 87.1%, and an average F1 score of 66.4% aggregated in two independent chest CT scan studies.},

This paper presents a framework for organ-specific image compression for teleinterventions based on a deep learning approach and anisotropic diffusion filter.<br><b>Methods:</b> The proposed method, DLAD, uses a CNN architecture to extract a probability map for the organ of interest; this probability map guides an anisotropic diffusion filter that smooths the image except at the location of the organ of interest. Subsequently, a compression method, such as BZ2 and HEVC-visually lossless, is applied to compress the image. We demonstrate the proposed method on 3D CT images acquired for radio frequency ablation (RFA) of liver lesions. We quantitatively evaluate the proposed method on 151 CT images using peak-signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity (SSIM) and compression ratio (CR) metrics. Finally, we compare the assessments of two radiologists on the liver lesion detection and the liver lesion center annotation using 33 sets of the original images and the compressed images.<br><b>Results:</b> The results show that the method can significantly improve CR of most well-known compression methods. DLAD combined with HEVC-visually lossless achieves the highest average CR of 6.45, which is 36% higher than that of the original HEVC and outperforms other state-of-the-art lossless medical image compression methods. The means of PSNR and SSIM are 70 dB and 0.95, respectively. In addition, the compression effects do not statistically significantly affect the assessments of the radiologists on the liver lesion detection and the lesion center annotation.<br><b>Conclusions:</b> We thus conclude that the method has a high potential to be applied in teleintervention applications.},

  abstract = {Imaging pulmonary fissures by CT provides useful information on diagnosis of pulmonary diseases. Automatic segmentation of fissures is a challenging task due to the variable appearance of fissures, such as inhomogeneous intensities, pathological deformation and imaging noise. To overcome these challenges, we propose an anisotropic differential operator called directional derivative of plate (DDoP) filter to probe the presence of fissure objects in 3D space by modeling the profile of a fissure patch with three parallel plates. To reduce the huge computation burden of dense matching with rotated DDoP kernels, a family of spherical harmonics are particularly utilized for acceleration. Additionally, a two-stage post-processing scheme is introduced to segment fissures. The performance of our method was verified in experiments using 55 scans from the publicly available LOLA11 dataset and 50 low-dose CT scans of lung cancer patients from the VIA-ELCAP database. Our method showed superior performance compared to the derivative of sticks (DoS) method and the Hessian-based method in terms of median and mean F1-score. The median F1-score for DDoP, DoS-based and Hessian-based methods on the LOLA11 dataset was 0.899, 0.848 and 0.843, respectively, and the mean F1-score was 0.858 &pm; 0.103, 0.781 &pm; 0.165 and 0.747 &pm; 0.239, respectively.},

While the previous approaches can produce good results, the accurate detection of motion remains a challenging task due to the difficulties raised by illumination variations, occlusion, camouflage, sudden motions appearing in burst, dynamic texture, and environmental changes such as those on weather conditions, sunlight changes during a day, etc. In this study, a novel per-pixel motion descriptor is proposed for motion detection in video sequences which outperforms the current methods in the literature particularly in severe scenarios. The proposed descriptor is based on two complementary three-dimensional discrete wavelet transforms (3D-DWT) and a three-dimensional wavelet leader. In this approach, a feature vector is extracted for each pixel by applying a novel three-dimensional wavelet-based motion descriptor. Then, the extracted features are clustered by the well-known K-means algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art approaches in several public benchmark datasets. The application of the proposed method and additional experimental results for several challenging datasets are available online.},

In this paper we propose an efficient preconditioner estimation method to improve the convergence rate of SGD. Based on the observed distribution of voxel displacements in the registration, we estimate the diagonal entries of a preconditioning matrix, thus rescaling the optimization cost function. The preconditioner is efficient to compute and employ, and can be used for mono-modal as well as multi-modal cost functions, in combination with different transformation models like the rigid, affine and B-spline model. Experiments on different clinical data sets show that the proposed method indeed improves the convergence rate compared to SGD with speedups around 2-5 in all tested settings, while retaining the same level of registration accuracy.},

  abstract = {<b>Purpose:</b> Morphological changes to anatomy resulting from invasive surgical procedures or pathology, typically alter the surrounding vasculature. This makes it useful as a descriptor for feature-driven image registration in various clinical applications. However, registration of vasculature remains challenging, as vessels often differ in size and shape, and may even miss branches, due to surgical interventions or pathological changes. Furthermore, existing vessel registration methods are typically designed for a specific application. To address this limitation, we propose a generic vessel registration approach useful for a variety of clinical applications, involving different anatomical regions.<br><b>Methods:</b> A probabilistic registration framework based on a hybrid mixture model, with a refinement mechanism to identify missing branches (denoted as HdMM+) during vasculature matching, is introduced. Vascular structures are represented as 6-dimensional hybrid point sets comprising spatial positions and centerline orientations, using Student's t-distributions to model the former and Watson distributions for the latter.<br><b>Results:</b> The proposed framework is evaluated for intraoperative brain shift compensation, and monitoring changes in pulmonary vasculature resulting from chronic lung disease. Registration accuracy is validated using both synthetic and patient data. Our results demonstrate, HdMM+ is able to reduce more than 85% of the initial error for both applications, and outperforms the state-of-the-art point-based registration methods such as coherent point drift (CPD) and Student's t-Distribution mixture model (TMM), in terms of mean surface distance, modified hausdorff distance, Dice and Jaccard scores.<br><b>Conclusion:</b> The proposed registration framework models complex vascular structures using a hybrid representation of vessel centerlines, and accommodates intricate variations in vascular morphology. Furthermore, it is generic and flexible in its design, enabling its use in a variety of clinical applications.},

  abstract = {<b>Purpose:</b> Vascular remodeling is a significant pathological feature of various pulmonary diseases, which may be assessed by quantitative CT imaging. The purpose of this study was therefore to develop and validate an automatic method for quantifying pulmonary vascular morphology in CT images.<br><b>Methods:</b> The proposed method consists of pulmonary vessel extraction and quantification. For extracting pulmonary vessels, a graph-cuts based method is proposed which considers appearance (CT intensity) and shape (vesselness from a Hessian-based filter) features, and incorporates distance to the airways into the cost function to prevent false detection of airway walls. For quantifying the extracted pulmonary vessels, a radius histogram is generated by counting the occurrence of vessel radii, calculated from a distance transform based method. Subsequently, two biomarkers, slope &alpha; and intercept &beta;, are calculated by linear regression on the radius histogram. A public data set from the VESSEL12 challenge was used to independently evaluate the vessel extraction. The quantitative analysis method was validated using images of a 3D printed vessel phantom, scanned by a clinical CT scanner and a micro-CT scanner (to obtain a gold standard). To confirm the association between imaging biomarkers and pulmonary function, 77 scleroderma patients were investigated with the proposed method.<br><b>Results:</b> In the independent evaluation with the public data set, our vessel segmentation method obtained an area under the ROC curve of 0.976. The median radius difference between clinical and micro-CT scans of a 3D printed vessel phantom was 0.062 &plusmn; 0.020 mm, with interquartile range of 0.199 &plusmn; 0.050 mm. In the studied patient group, a significant correlation between diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide and the biomarkers, &alpha; (R=-0.27, p-value=0.018) and &beta; (R=0.321, p-value=0.004), was obtained.<br><b>Conclusions:</b> In conclusion, the proposed method was highly accurate, validated with a public data set and a 3D printed vessel phantom data set. The correlation between imaging biomarkers and diffusion capacity in a clinical data set confirmed an association between lung structure and function. This quantification of pulmonary vascular morphology may be helpful in understanding the pathophysiology of pulmonary vascular diseases.},

The automatic bladder segmentation alongside the CT scan are jointly optimized to add explicit knowledge about the underlying anatomy to the registration algorithm. We included three datasets from different institutes and CT manufacturers. The first was used for training and testing the ConvNet, where the second and the third were used for evaluation of the proposed pipeline. The system performance was quantified geometrically using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), the Mean Surface Distance (MSD), and the 95% Hausdorff Distance (HD). The propagated contours were validated clinically through generating the associated IMPT plans and compare it with the IMPT plans based on the manual delineations. Propagated contours were considered clinically acceptable if their treatment plans met the dosimetric coverage constraints on the manual contours.<br><b>Results:</b> The bladder segmentation network achieved a DSC of 88% and 82% on the test datasets. The proposed registration pipeline achieved a MSD of 1.29 &plusmn; 0.39, 1.48 &plusmn; 1.16, and 1.49 &plusmn; 0.44 mm for the prostate, seminal vesicles, and lymph nodes, respectively on the second dataset and a MSD of 2.31 &plusmn; 1.92 and 1.76 &plusmn; 1.39 mm for the prostate and seminal vesicles on the third dataset. The automatically propagated contours met the dose coverage constraints in 86%, 91%, and 99% of the cases for the prostate, seminal vesicles, and lymph nodes, respectively. A Conservative Success Rate (CSR) of 80% was obtained, compared to 65% when only using intensity-based registration.<br><b>Conclusions:</b> The proposed registration pipeline obtained highly promising results for generating treatment plans adapted to the daily anatomy. With 80% of the automatically generated treatment plans directly usable without manual correction, a substantial improvement in system robustness was reached compared to a previous approach. The proposed method therefore facilitates more precise proton therapy of prostate cancer, potentially leading to fewer treatment related adverse side effects.},

In addition, quantitative error prediction can be helpful in improving the registration quality. The task of predicting registration error is demanding due to the lack of a ground truth in medical images. This paper proposes a new automatic method to predict the registration error in a quantitative manner, and is applied to chest CT scans. A random regression forest is utilized to predict the registration error locally. The forest is built with features related to the transformation model and features related to the dissimilarity after registration. The forest is trained and tested using manually annotated corresponding points between pairs of chest CT scans in two experiments: SPREAD (trained and tested on SPREAD) and inter-database (including three databases SPREAD, DIR-Lab-4DCT and DIR-Lab-COPDgene). The results show that the mean absolute errors of regression are 1.07 &plusmn; 1.86 and 1.76 &plusmn; 2.59 mm for the SPREAD and inter-database experiment, respectively. The overall accuracy of classification in three classes (correct, poor and wrong registration) is 90.7% and 75.4%, for SPREAD and inter-database respectively. The good performance of the proposed method enables important applications such as automatic quality control in large-scale image analysis.},

  abstract = {Image registration, the process of aligning two or more images, is the core technique of many (semi-)automatic medical image analysis tasks. Recent studies have shown that deep learning methods, notably convolutional neural networks (ConvNets), can be used for image registration. Thus far training of ConvNets for registration was supervised using predefined example registrations. However, obtaining example registrations is not trivial. To circumvent the need for predefined examples, and thereby to increase convenience of training ConvNets for image registration, we propose the Deep Learning Image Registration (DLIR) framework for unsupervised affine and deformable image registration. In the DLIR framework ConvNets are trained for image registration by exploiting image similarity analogous to conventional intensity-based image registration. After a ConvNet has been trained with the DLIR framework, it can be used to register pairs of unseen images in one shot. We propose flexible ConvNets designs for affine image registration and for deformable image registration. By stacking multiple of these ConvNets into a larger architecture, we are able to perform coarse-to-fine image registration. We show for registration of cardiac cine MRI and registration of chest CT that performance of the DLIR framework is comparable to conventional image registration while being several orders of magnitude faster.},

  abstract = {In recent years, machine learning approaches have been successfully applied to the field of neuroimaging for classification and regression tasks. However, many approaches do not give an intuitive relation between the raw features and the diagnosis. Therefore, they are difficult for clinicians to interpret. Moreover, most approaches treat the features extracted from the brain (for example, voxelwise gray matter concentration maps from brain MRI) as independent variables and ignore their spatial and anatomical relations. In this paper, we present a new Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based learning method for the classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which integrates spatial-anatomical information. In this way, spatial-neighbor features in the same anatomical region are encouraged to have similar weights in the SVM model. Secondly, to make the learned model more interpretable, we introduce a group lasso penalty to induce structure sparsity, which may help clinicians to assess the key regions involved in the disease. For solving this learning problem, we use an accelerated proximal gradient descent approach. We tested our method on the subset of ADNI data selected by Cuingnet et al. (2011) for Alzheimer's disease classification, as well as on an independent larger dataset from ADNI. Good classification performance is obtained for distinguishing cognitive normals (CN) vs. AD, as well as on distinguishing between various sub-types (e.g. CN vs. Mild Cognitive Impairment). The model trained on Cuignet's dataset for AD vs. CN classification was directly used without re-training to the independent larger dataset. Good performance was achieved, demonstrating the generalizability of the proposed methods. For all experiments, the classification results are comparable or better than the state-of-the-art, while the weight map more clearly indicates the key regions related to Alzheimer's disease.},

To gain more insight into this variation, we designed a method for visualizing and quantifying changes in pulmonary perfusion by automatically comparing computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography before and after BPA treatment. We validated these quantifications of perfusion changes against hemodynamic changes measured with right-sided heart catheterization.<br><b>Materials and Methods:</b> We studied 14 consecutive CTEPH patients (12 women; age, 70.5 {\pm} 24), who underwent CT pulmonary angiography and right-sided heart catheterization, before and after BPA. Posttreatment images were registered to pretreatment CT scans (using the Elastix toolbox) to obtain corresponding locations. Pulmonary vascular trees and their centerlines were detected using a graph cuts method and a distance transform method, respectively. Areas distal from vessels were defined as pulmonary parenchyma. Subsequently, the density changes within the vascular centerlines and parenchymal areas were calculated and corrected for inspiration level differences. For visualization, the densitometric changes were displayed in color-coded overlays. For quantification, the median and interquartile range of the density changes in the vascular and parenchymal areas (&Delta;VD and &Delta;PD) were calculated. The recorded changes in hemodynamic parameters, including changes in systolic, diastolic, mean pulmonary artery pressure (&Delta;sPAP, &Delta;dPAP and &Delta;mPAP, respectively) and vascular resistance (&Delta;PVR), were used as reference assessments of the treatment effect. Spearman correlation coefficients were employed to investigate the correlations between changes in perfusion and hemodynamic changes.<br><b>Results:</b> Comparative imaging maps showed distinct patterns in perfusion changes among patients. Within pulmonary vessels, the interquartile range of &Delta;VD correlated significantly with &Delta;sPAP (R= 0.58, p=0.03), &Delta;dPAP (R= 0.71, p=0.005), &Delta;mPAP (R= 0.71, p=0.005), and &Delta;PVR (R= 0.77, p=0.001).

  abstract = {With an increasing number of large-scale population-based cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging studies being conducted nowadays, there comes the mammoth task of image annotation and image analysis. Such population-based studies would greatly benefit from automated pipelines, with an efficient CMR image analysis workflow. The purpose of this work is to investigate the feasibility of using a fully-automatic pipeline to segment the left ventricular endocardium and epicardium simultaneously on two orthogonal (vertical and horizontal) long-axis cardiac cine MRI scans. The pipeline is based on a multi-atlas-based segmentation approach and a spatio-temporal registration approach. The performance of the method was assessed by: (i) comparing the automatic segmentations to those obtained manually at both the end-diastolic and end-systolic phase, (ii) comparing the automatically obtained clinical parameters, including end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume, stroke volume and ejection fraction, with those defined manually and (iii) by the accuracy of classifying subjects to the appropriate risk category based on the estimated ejection fraction. Automatic segmentation of the left ventricular endocardium was achieved with a Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.93 on the end-diastolic phase for both the vertical and horizontal long-axis scan; on the end-systolic phase the DSC was 0.88 and 0.85, respectively. For the epicardium, a DSC of 0.94 and 0.95 was obtained on the end-diastolic vertical and horizontal long-axis scans; on the end-systolic phase the DSC was 0.90 and 0.88, respectively. With respect to the clinical volumetric parameters, Pearson correlation coefficient (R) of 0.97 was obtained for the end-diastolic volume, 0.95 for end-systolic volume, 0.87 for stroke volume and 0.84 for ejection fraction. Risk category classification based on ejection fraction showed that 80% of the subjects were assigned to the correct risk category and only one subject (< 1%) was more than one risk category off. We conclude that the proposed automatic pipeline presents a viable and cost-effective alternative for manual annotation.},

  abstract = {Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is an intermediate stage between healthy and Alzheimer's disease (AD). To enable early intervention it is important to identify the MCI subjects that will convert to AD in an early stage. In this paper, we provide a new method to distinguish between MCI patients that either convert to Alzheimer's Disease (MCIc) or remain stable (MCIs), using only longitudinal T1-weighted MRI. Currently, most longitudinal studies focus on volumetric comparison of a few anatomical structures, thereby ignoring more detailed development inside and outside those structures. In this study we propose to exploit the anatomical development within the entire brain, as found by a non-rigid registration approach. Specifically, this anatomical development is represented by the stationary velocity field (SVF) from registration between the baseline and follow-up images. To make the SVFs comparable among subjects, we use the parallel transport method to align them in a common space. The normalized SVF together with derived features are then used to distinguish between MCIc and MCIs subjects. This novel feature space is reduced using a Kernel Principal Component Analysis method, and a linear support vector machine is used as a classifier. Extensive comparative experiments are performed to inspect the influence of several aspects of our method on classification performance, specifically the feature choice, the smoothing parameter in the registration and the use of dimensionality reduction. The optimal result from a 10-fold cross-validation using 36 month follow-up data shows competitive results: accuracy 92%, sensitivity 95%, specificity 90%, and AUC 94%. Based on the same dataset, the proposed approach outperforms two alternative ones that either depends on the baseline image only, or uses longitudinal information from larger brain areas. Good results were also obtained when scans at 6, 12 or 24 months were used for training the classifier. Besides the classification power, the proposed method can quantitatively compare brain regions that have a significant difference in development between the MCIc and MCIs groups.},

  abstract = {Pulmonary fissures are important landmarks for recognition of lung anatomy. In CT images, automatic detection of fissures is complicated by factors like intensity variability, pathological deformation and imaging noise. To circumvent this problem, we propose a derivative of stick (DoS) filter for fissure enhancement and a post-processing pipeline for subsequent segmentation. Considering a typical thin curvilinear shape of fissure profiles inside 2D cross-sections, the DoS filter is presented by first defining nonlinear derivatives along a triple stick kernel in varying directions. Then, to accommodate pathological abnormality and orientational deviation, a max-min cascading and multiple plane integration scheme is adopted to form a shape-tuned likelihood for 3D surface patches discrimination. During the post-processing stage, our main contribution is to isolate the fissure patches from adhering clutters by introducing a branch-point removal algorithm, and a multi-threshold merging framework is employed to compensate for local intensity inhomogeneity. The performance of our method was validated in experiments with two clinical CT data sets including 55 publicly available LOLA11 scans as well as separate left and right lung images from 23 GLUCOLD scans of COPD patients. Compared with manually delineating interlobar boundary references, our method obtained a high segmentation accuracy with median F1-scores of 0.833, 0.885, and 0.856 for the LOLA11, left and right lung images respectively, whereas the corresponding indices for a conventional Wiemker filtering method were 0.687, 0.853, and 0.841. The good performance of our proposed method was also verified by visual inspection and demonstration on abnormal and pathological cases, where typical deformations were robustly detected together with normal fissures.},

Local search induces a cost space per voxel which we explore further to estimate the confidence of the registration similar to confidence estimation algorithms for stereo matching. We test our method on both synthetically generated registration errors and on real registrations with ground truth. The experimental results show that our confidence measure can estimate registration errors and it is correlated with local errors.},

  abstract = {Fast automatic image registration is an important prerequisite for image guided clinical procedures. However, due to the large number of voxels in an image and the complexity of registration algorithms, this process is often very slow. Among many classical optimization strategies, stochastic gradient descent is a powerful method to iteratively solve the registration problem. This procedure relies on a proper selection of the optimization step size, which is important for the optimization procedure to converge. This step size selection is difficult to perform manually, since it depends on the input data, similarity measure and transformation model. The Adaptive Stochastic Gradient Descent (ASGD) method has been proposed to automatically choose the step size, but it comes at a high computational cost, dependent on the number of transformation parameters.<br>In this paper, we propose a new computationally efficient method (fast ASGD) to automatically determine the step size for gradient descent methods, by considering the observed distribution of the voxel displacements between iterations. A relation between the step size and the expectation and variance of the observed distribution is derived. While ASGD has quadratic complexity with respect to the transformation parameters, the fast ASGD method only has linear complexity. Extensive validation has been performed on different datasets with different modalities, inter/intra subjects, different similarity measures and transformation models. To perform a large scale experiment on 3D MR brain data, we have developed efficient and reusable tools to exploit an international high performance computing facility. For all experiments, we obtained similar accuracy as ASGD. Moreover, the estimation time of the fast ASGD method is reduced to a very small value, from 40 seconds to less than 1 second when the number of parameters is 10<sup>5</sup>, almost 40 times faster. Depending on the registration settings, the total registration time is reduced by a factor of 2.5-7x for the experiments in this paper.},

Based on the earlier reports that full brain maturation requires at least three months in rats, there is a clear need to discern the corresponding minimal animal age to provide an "adult brain" in mice in order to avoid modulation of disease progression/therapy studies by ongoing developmental changes. For this purpose, we have studied anatomical brain alterations of mice during their first six months of age. Using T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted MRI, structural and volume changes of the brain were identified and compared with histological analysis of myelination. Mouse brain volume was found to be almost stable already at three weeks, but cortex thickness kept decreasing continuously with maximal changes during the first three months. Myelination is still increasing between three and six months, although most dramatic changes are over by three months. While our results emphasize that mice should be at least three months old when adult animals are needed for brain studies, preferred choice of one particular metric for future investigation goals will result in somewhat varying age windows of stabilization.},

The algorithm developed consists of two core parts (i) 3D volume reconstruction from different stations with simultaneous correction of different types of intensity inhomogeneity, and (ii) Extraction of the arterial tree and subsequent labelling of the pruned extracted tree. Extraction of the arterial tree is performed using the probability map of the "contrast" class, which is obtained as one of the results of the inhomogeneity correction scheme. We demonstrate that such approach is more robust than using the difference between the pre- and post-contrast channels traditionally used for this purpose. Labelling the extracted tree is performed by using a combination of graph-based and atlas-based approaches. Validation of our method with respect to the extracted tree was performed on the arterial tree subdivided into 32 segments, 82.4% of which were completely detected, 11.7% partially detected, and 5.9% were missed on a cohort of 35 subjects. With respect to automated labelling accuracy of the 32 segments, various registration strategies were investigated on a training set consisting of 10 scans. Further analysis on the test set consisting of 25 data sets indicates that 69% of the vessel centerline tree in the head and neck region, 80% in the thorax and abdomen region, and 84% in the legs was accurately labelled to the correct vessel segment. These results indicate clinical potential of our approach in enabling fully automated and accurate analysis of the entire arterial tree. This is the first study that not only automatically extracts the WB-MRA arterial tree, but also labels the vessel tree segments.},

It divides CT scans of the brain into ASPECTS regions using atlas-based segmentation. EICs are quantified by comparing the brain density between contralateral sides. This method was optimized and validated using CT data from 10 and 63 patients, respectively. The automated method was validated against manual ASPECTS, stroke severity at baseline and clinical outcome after 7 to 10 days (NIH Stroke Scale, NIHSS) and 3 months (modified Rankin Scale). Manual and automated ASPECTS showed similar and statistically significant correlations with baseline NIHSS (R=-0.399 and -0.277, respectively) and with follow-up mRS (R=-0.256 and -0.272), except for the follow-up NIHSS. Agreement between automated and consensus ASPECTS reading was similar to the interobserver agreement of manual ASPECTS (differences <1 point in 73% of cases). The automated ASPECTS method could, therefore, be used as a supplementary tool to assist manual scoring.},

Vessel segmentation is fundamental in computer aided processing of data generated by 3D imaging modalities. As manual vessel segmentation is prohibitively time consuming, any real world application requires some form of automation. Several approaches exist for automated vessel segmentation, but judging their relative merits is difficult due to a lack of standardized evaluation. We present an annotated reference dataset containing 20 CT scans and propose nine categories to perform a comprehensive evaluation of vessel segmentation algorithms from both academia and industry. Twenty algorithms participated in the VESSEL12 challenge, held at International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2012. All results have been published at the VESSEL12 website http://vessel12.grand-challenge.org. The challenge remains ongoing and open to new participants. Our three contributions are: (1) an annotated reference dataset available online for evaluation of new algorithms; (2) a quantitative scoring system for objective comparison of algorithms; and (3) performance analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the various vessel segmentation methods in the presence of various lung diseases.},

  abstract = {<b>Purpose:</b> Whole lung densitometry on chest CT images is an accepted method for measuring tissue destruction in patients with pulmonary emphysema in clinical trials. Progression measurement is required for evaluation of change in health condition and the effect of drug treatment. Information about the location of emphysema progression within the lung may be important for the correct interpretation of drug efficacy, or for determining a treatment plan. The purpose of this study is therefore to develop and validate methods that enable the local measurement of lung density changes, which requires proper modeling of the effect of respiration on density.<br><b>Methods:</b> Four methods, all based on registration of baseline and follow-up chest CT scans, are compared. The first naive method subtracts registered images. The second employs the so-called dry sponge model, where volume correction is performed using the determinant of the Jacobian of the transformation. The third and the fourth introduce a novel adaptation of the dry sponge model that circumvents its constant-mass assumption, which is shown to be invalid. The latter two methods require a third CT scan at a different inspiration level to estimate the patient-specific density-volume slope, where one method employs a global and the other a local slope. The methods were validated on CT scans of a phantom mimicking the lung, where mass and volume could be controlled. In addition, validation was performed on data of 21 patients with pulmonary emphysema.<br><b>Results:</b> The image registration method was optimized leaving a registration error below half the slice increment (median 1.0mm). The phantom study showed that the locally adapted slope model most accurately measured local progression. The systematic error in estimating progression, as measured on the phantom data, was below 2 gr/l for a 70 ml (6%) volume difference, and 5 gr/l for a 210 ml (19%) difference, if volume correction was applied. On the patient data an underlying linearity assumption relating lung volume change with density change was shown to hold (fit R<sup>2</sup> = 0.94), and globalized versions of the local models are consistent with global results (R<sup>2</sup> of 0.865 and 0.882 for the two adapted slope models, respectively).<br><b>Conclusions:</b> In conclusion, image matching and subsequent analysis of differences according to the proposed lung models i) has good local registration accuracy on patient data, ii) effectively eliminates a dependency on inspiration level at acquisition time, iii) accurately predicts progression in phantom data, and iv) is reasonably consistent with global results in patient data. It is therefore a potential future tool for assessing local emphysema progression in drug evaluation trials and in clinical practice.},

Substituting the patient-specific bone shapes with personalizable models, such as statistical shape models (SSM), could eliminate the CT/MRI acquisitions, and thereby decrease costs and radiation dose (when eliminating CT). SSM based kinematics, however, have not yet been evaluated on clinically relevant joint motion parameters.<br>Therefore, in this work the applicability of SSM-s for computing knee kinematics from biplane fluoroscopic sequences was explored. Kinematic precision with an edge based automated bone tracking method using SSM-s was evaluated on 6 cadaver and 10 in-vivo fluoroscopic sequences. The SSMs of the femur and the tibia-fibula were created using 61 training datasets. Kinematic precision was determined for medial-lateral tibial shift, anterior-posterior tibial drawer, joint distraction-contraction, flexion, tibial rotation and adduction. The relationship between kinematic precision and bone shape accuracy was also investigated.<br>The SSM based kinematics resulted in sub-millimeter (0.48-0.81 mm) and approximately one degree (0.69-0.99{^{\circ}}) median precision on the cadaveric knees compared to bone-marker-based kinematics. The precision on the in-vivo datasets was comparable to the cadaveric sequences when evaluated with a semi-automatic reference method. These results are promising, though further work is necessary to reach the accuracy of CT-based kinematics. We also demonstrated that a better shape reconstruction accuracy does not automatically imply a better kinematic precision. This result suggests that the ability of accurately fitting the edges in the fluoroscopic sequences has a larger role in determining the kinematic precision than the overall 3D shape accuracy.},

We have performed a high-resolution longitudinal MRI study at 11.7T of male Wistar rats between 21 days and six months of age, characterizing cerebral volume changes and tissue-specific myelination as a function of age. Cortical thickness reaches final value at 1 month, while volume increases of cortex, striatum and whole brain end only after two months. Myelin accretion is pronounced until the end of the third postnatal month. After this time, continuing myelination increases in cortex are still seen on histological analysis but are no longer reliably detectable with diffusion-weighted MRI due to parallel tissue restructuring processes.

  abstract = {<b>Purpose:</b> Atherosclerosis is the primary cause of heart disease and stroke. The detailed assessment of atherosclerosis of the carotid artery requires high resolution imaging of the vessel wall using multiple MR sequences with different contrast weightings. These images allow manual or automated classification of plaque components inside the vessel wall. Automated classification requires all sequences to be in alignment, which is hampered by patient motion. In clinical practice correction of this motion is performed manually. Previous studies applied automated image registration to correct for motion using only non-deformable transformation models and did not perform a detailed quantitative validation. The purpose of this study is to develop an automated accurate 3D registration method, and to extensively validate this method on a large set of patient data. In addition, we quantified patient motion during scanning to investigate the need for correction.|<b>Methods:</b> MR imaging studies (1.5T, dedicated carotid surface coil, Philips) from fifty-five TIA/stroke patients with ipsilateral <70% carotid artery stenosis were randomly selected from a larger cohort. Five MR pulse sequences were acquired around the carotid bifurcation, each containing nine transverse slices: T1W TFE, TOF, T2W TSE, and pre- and post-contrast T1W TSE. The images were manually segmented by delineating the lumen contour in each vessel wall sequence and were manually aligned by applying through-plane and in-plane translations to the images. To find the optimal automatic image registration method, different masks, choice of the fixed image, different types of the mutual information image similarity metric, and transformation models including 3D deformable transformation models, were evaluated. Evaluation of the automatic registration results was performed by comparing the lumen segmentations of the fixed image and moving image after registration.|<b>Results:</b> The average required manual translation per image slice was 1.33 mm. Translations were larger as the patient was longer inside the scanner. Manual alignment took 187.5 seconds per patient resulting in a mean surface distance of 0.271 {\pm} 0.127 mm. After minimal user interaction to generate the mask in the fixed image, the remaining sequences are automatically registered with a computation time of 52.0 seconds per patient. The optimal registration strategy used a circular mask with a diameter of 10 mm, a 3D B-spline transformation model with a control point spacing of 15 mm, mutual information as image similarity metric, and the pre-contrast T1W TSE as fixed image. A mean surface distance of 0.288 {\pm} 0.128 mm was obtained with these settings, which is very close to the accuracy of the manual alignment procedure. The exact registration parameters and software were made publicly available.|<b>Conclusions:</b> An automated registration method was developed and optimized, only needing two mouse clicks to mark the start and end point of the artery. Validation on a large group of patients showed that automated image registration has similar accuracy as the manual alignment procedure, substantially reducing the amount of user interactions needed, and is multiple times faster. In conclusion, we believe that the proposed automated method can replace the current manual procedure, thereby reducing the time to analyze the images.},

  abstract = {<i>Purpose</i> Whole-body MRI is seeing increasing use in the study and diagnosis of disease progression. In this, a central task is the visual assessment of the progressive changes that occur between two whole-body MRI datasets, taken at baseline and follow-up. Current radiological workflow for this consists in manual search of each organ of interest on both scans, usually on multiple data channels, for further visual comparison. Large size of datasets, significant posture differences, and changes in patient anatomy turn manual matching in an extremely labour-intensive task that requires from radiologists high concentration for long period of time. This strongly limits the productivity and increases risk of underdiagnosis.|<i>Materials and Methods</i> We present a novel approach to the comparative visual analysis of whole-body MRI follow-up data. Our method is based on interactive derivation of locally rigid transforms from a pre-computed whole-body deformable registration. Using this approach, baseline and follow-up slices can be interactively matched with a single mouse-click in the anatomical region of interest. In addition to the synchronized side-by-side baseline and matched follow-up slices, we have integrated four techniques to further facilitate the visual comparison of the two datasets: the "deformation sphere", the color fusion view, the magic lens, and a set of uncertainty iso-contours around the current region of interest.|<i>Results</i> We have applied our method to the study of cancerous bone lesions over time in patients with Kahler's disease. During these studies, the radiologist carefully visually examines a large number of anatomical sites for changes. Our interactive locally rigid matching approach was found helpful in localization of cancerous lesions and visual assessment of changes between different scans. Furthermore, each of the features integrated in our software was separately evaluated by the experts.|<i>Conclusions</i> We demonstrated how our method significantly facilitates examination of whole-body MR datasets in follow-up studies by enabling the rapid interactive matching of regions of interest and by the explicit visualization of change.},
